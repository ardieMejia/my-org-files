* Every programmers is a retard once again, MongoDB has collections:
** Collections are containers of related documents
** Comparison:
*** showing databases:
**** show databases (both)
*** select all rows from table:
**** select * from tablename
**** db.tablename.find()
***** db.tablename.find(), oooooooh pretty
*** conditional select:
**** select * from tablename where something = something
**** db.tablename.find({something:something})
** My initial thought: might be more consistent with how you display websites in general
*** 2 ways to create:
**** insert(), *on the fly*
**** createCollection(), *explicit*
** From perspective of MySQL, /collection IS table/

** Engineer Meeting <2019-03-07 Kha>
*** Dont remember points about less or sass
*** I need to learn blade templates more advanced syntax
*** Learn about lang folder
**** Personal notes:
***** In order to use middleware along with Route:: command, it needs to be declared inside kernel.php
****** You can is alongside Route::group([]), inside an array
****** or add it as an additional function aka: ->middleware('someshittystring')
*** git immersion, please complete this tutorial
**** difference between rebasing vs merging
**** What we learnt:
***** Apparently, you cna also checkout a file (git checkout filename1), weird. But maybe only in the context of reset
***** revert HEAD, is a powerful feature, not another "git config"
***** reset or ammend acheive similar effects in Git
***** More confusion, and what we did:
****** First we edited "master" tag in .git/config to point to ardieOrigin, aka "our master", which is always better
****** Then, when we do a git checkout master, error message is "upstream is gone" (git checkout ardieOrigin/master also doesnt work)
******* becoz our fetches are out-of-date ??
****** git fetch ardieOrigin # ---------- this fixes it
****** git rebase ardieorigin/master # ---------- should practice this some more
****** (so fetch and rebase, instead of pull)
***** So, the assumption of unienrol's system the bug branch

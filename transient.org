*** Is Emacs enough from being trapped in a singular software ecosystem (Eg: Apple)?
**** Even for something as simple as search and replace, there lacks a  "repository" of "best practices". Although, it might be easy for me, its certainly straightforward enough for beginners
**** Advantages: A consistent language paradigm across all its "tools" (packages, configs, etc...)
**** Advantages: A ridiculus easy excuse to experiment with the functional paradigm without guilt (No installation whatsoever)
**** Possible cons: Personally, I use Emacs for a TODO and knowledge manager (categorizing blogs and links). Some coders Ive met dont seem to be interested in that
**** Possible cons: Coders who have tried (and gave up) seem to sight (either from experience or anecdote from other coders), of the Emacs pinky condition. While most cited solutions is mapping Caps Lock to Ctrl, I rewire my brain to always use both hand (Eg: Ctrl-p becomes Left-Ctrl and p, Ctrl-f, becomes Right-Ctrl and f). Rewire your brain doesnt seem a compelling argument enough.
**** Possible advantages: Learning Lisp might lead you to an incredible journey of self-discovery of other extensible tools. (GUIX, Nyxt browser)
*** clickbait thumbnails that are more artistic
*** what I wished I knew about programming earlier on
*** Why handtools in woodworking?
**** Apart from the obvious artistic/crafty and detail reasons. There's a reason some woodworkers still use handtools despite the over-advertising of power tools. Its accuracy. Some woodworkers know this instinctively but cant put it on words. Utilizing all your 5 senses enhances accuracy, where powertools add an overpowered layer separating the woodworker from their product. When you feel and see the cuts, the planed surfaces, you ensure accuracy. Becoz a mistake multiplies in the face of your senses. We use sunlight before mating 2 wooden surface. And thats just 1 example, of multiplying the mistakes/perfection, when we use higher senses. Its not some airy nonsense of "artistry" (becoz art seems like a dirty word to some engineers, very strange).

** The best way to read CSS frameworks, while learning an actual project in your real work, while also spending time doing your personal project, is to read all the documentation of several. Im currently reading both Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. The frameworks come from different perspectives and opinions. And trying to get into the mind fo the guys who created the "language", means trying to think "what is the creator trying to convey", when reading all their documentations. 
** Think of a project to use with typst
*** Also write something about typst
** We are going to publish our site, either in render or fly.io
** Remember to move image files from Hanifas laptop during the meeting later.
** Store this link somewhere ([[https://www.svgrepo.com/vectors/please-check-your-input-invalid-input/][svgrepo]])

*** write about how you successfully did flex properly (3 child divs). Also flex and grid-cols dont mix very well. Remember to note how you read repeatedly sources from Bootstrap and Tailwind docs to get a sense of  CSS logic. You also tried to memorize slightly tailwind CSS. 
*** Do you want to write about thinking in terms of context.

*** Convincing others:
**** A few things that scare newcomers and Vimers, or frustrations that turn them away after trying Emacs for a month or two
***** Ctrl Alt haevy, aka pinky finger. An overly cool solution: Hydra Mode and Key Chords, you'll be able to do stuff no-one else can do
***** typing the wrong way, yes there is such a thing at least, not ideal, but this has a lot more to do, physical wiring of motor skills in the brain
***** awkward defaults, overcome, with searching for "sensible defaults" for config ideas
***** Emacs having the image of dinosaurs IDE, or an old mans IDE: Not true at all, witaout going into complete detail, cool packages that are new-ish that make your Emacs feel completely different or even radical. Hydra-mode, Helm, Vertico, Hydra-mode, Emacs Application Framework (if youre willing to install Python modules globally) and so many more.
**** Reasons why I proseltize Emacs:
***** Sincerely believe it would benefit non-programmers more than programmers, especially who love both writing and coding, and cant live without writing. And programmers, even myself included, are often opinionated with biases towards what is correct and non-correct in technology.
***** Removing stereotypes, contrary to belief, Emacs communtiy are not wholly insular. Many partsa of the community, are increbly open and progressive, and pushing for changes such as Emacs default being less weird (I personally, dont understand why searching for "recent-files" is not enabled by default, I always forget the exact config, and have to copy it from some blog, when setting up Emacs on a new system).
***** A consistent and fun to learn language across the entire ecosystem. If you want to be really cool, you can learn Lisp in both Emas and Nyxt (web browser which also uses a Lisp, very hackable). Even cooler? use Nyxt and Emacs inside GUIX (a stateless Operating System using Guile Scheme Lisp entirely, personally Ive never tried this). GUIX is something Ive always wanted to try, but not enough resources to buy a new laptop at the moment. GUIX is quite cool if you can get the hang of it, coz if Im not mistake, it has the concept of "profiles", which means every "state", every installation, every change is reproducible. From a laymans term, its like Apple's Time Machine. Whatever happens to your system, you can roll back to a previous "state". As a programmer, I imagine everyone here understands the idea of "state", or at least understands it on a "feel" level.
***** We need more David beating up Big Tech Goliaths
**** But enough about that, why would YOU want to learn Emacs?
***** Lets think of it this way. Everyone was once an idiot, yes, thats right, even Seniors, they were also once idiots. C programmers, Lispers, Web Developers, we were all once idiots
***** If you are like me, Emacs and its ecosystem, is perhaps the ONLY technology of its kind, that rewards you if you know more. The more you read and explore and experiment, the higher returns. You cant say that for most things in the programming world. Sometimes, knowing more punishes you. 
**** Non-destructive ways to test Emacs packages:
***** use the try package. Then do the usual use-package, or any normal config for that package you found online.
**** Community
***** Anyone who knows of any other Emacs "community" or learning resource. Obviously, I cant discover everything by myself. This is me hoping to inspire those who havent made the leap towards Emacs but always wanted to. Hopefully I learn something from this too.
**** Proper 1:
***** My last post seem to attract a few (maybe too few) interested folks. So here I am posting again. I need help in organizing learning material (or learning community) to help spread Emacs. The ones Im familiar so far, SystemCrafters (fresh and progressive, from beginers to advanced), Xah Lee (very opinionated, but knowledgeable on programming concepts and paradigms, his "look" is misleading, hes more progressive than first impression). This is also a learning experience for myself too.
***** Also, as a side note, Im hunting for a job change, and would like to use this opportunity to connect, either for job/business/community opportunities. Im desperately in need of more opportunities and connections with like minded people. If I wanted to get into more Python based work, what are the areas I should be focusing on? I quite like the language element of Python, exploring the newer features. But sometimes, what the market demands often dont match where the language (Python) itself is heading in terms of development. If I were to go into Machine Learning, what is the market like and what should I be studying?
*** create a emacs script that calls magick on any dired
*** emacs iconfy frame with emacs client should work with non-openbox managers. try that with a new laptop
*** Ive installed Nyxt browser, uses Common Lisp, havent fully explored, but the documentation is fun to read so far. 
**** The word hacking can have both negative and positive connotations. Even if one were to remove the negative MORAL connotations, hacking in your OWN code and software seems to imply a sort of un-naturalness, as if expecting something to break.
**** Reading eLisp, Emacs and now Nyxt browser documentation, I get the impression that hacking can be both pleasant when there is consistency in the ecosystem. Maybe should try that approach in convincing others. Yes, writing is hard work. But writing both beautifully yet meaningfully accurate is even harder. 
**** I remember my first few but very huge fears when I used Emacs the first time. Feels like treading on literal abstraction. More like walking on nothingness. Nowadays, I feel less of that fear. I think partly its becoz, one knows that all software Apple/Android/Windows/whatever is essentially an elaborate hack. Just gotta turn your hack into a work of art. Art as in beauty in words and language, I guess.
**** Wow, this post seems just another rant.
*** try perspective el
*** Also try Emacs Application Framework on a new laptop
*** You like trying cool custom personalized Emacs el. This one is useful simpler bookmark, might help a lot in you html editing: [[https://github.com/joodland/bm][here]]
*** we are professional, so we need to make Python SUBMIT to us. [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3372/coloring-indentation-levels][Color diff indentation levels]]
*** we need another Hydra to ehsily go to other-window using (other-window 1)
*** [[https://zck.org/define-keymap][keymap]] very cool stuff
*** web-mode-element-wrap must be hydra-ed. We also need to auto-select a whole delimiter. But first try the stackoverflow templating engine trick.
*** We need to learn this Emacs [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/23810/getting-proper-indentation-for-python-flask-templates][templating indent]] mode thingy
*** we are going to try to use enriched mode to color Emacs
** Store this cool [[https://www.andrewvillazon.com/move-data-to-db-with-sqlalchemy/][declarative_base]] link, coz we managed to make it work for bulk upload. Note how you dont need to remove your usual model in your class. The declarative_model simply maps your class with the existing table.
** override modus theme, a masterpiece theme according to 1 guy, into a [[https://github.com/idlip/haki/tree/haki][high contrast tasheme]]
** Store this [[https://yannesposito.com/posts/0020-cool-looking-org-mode/index.html][cool Emacs link]] somewhere
** Copy Hanifas key
** FB:
*** post your spokeshaves both photos and in action. In FB "handmade tools" group first. Then elsewhere
*** Write about the death of personal computing. Make it relatable. Think of relating the topic with Haiku. Complain slightly about these being a time sink. Also relate to GUIX, Nix, and Emacs.
*** I know some of you are not particular attached to the idea of writing for your own personal sake. In our world, the code itself is documentation. But I can never help feel childish and selfish when it comes to having something personal to write on. I have a personal diary which I write on my favourite piece of software. I find that it helps even when it comes to small stuff (like installing a piece of software, or creating a new repo). I find that it personally helps me with my personal hobbies too (as I have trouble separating between professional work and passionate side project). What setup do you guys have that helps with dealing with the complexity that comes with this job (and the complexity that comes from dealing with separating professional like and side projects). A diary? A knowledge manage system like Obsidian?
*** I guess one of the reason I struggled with frameworks for the longest time, is becoz the template "language" confused how i thnk of code "state" in general
** Post on LinkIn, you dontactually need a big project to practice using frameworks. Just start with a very simple selfish, even stupid idea. Many of the modern frameworks we have out there are quite progressive, meaning as long as you have some idea of good code organization, your stupid ( and big and creative) idea can be made gradually better. Dont be intimidated by all the naysayers out there. Or maybe that only happened to me. But frameworks can be applied gradually to your creative idea. So I tried it with the stupid idea of using Excel as a data base using this REPO as a base. It works, I carefully replace with little bits of Flask here and there.
#+begin_quote

You dont actually need to treat web frameworks with fear. I just only learnt this. Modern frameworks are quite progressive in their nature. This means as long as you have some idea of good code organization and abstraction. Your random, stupid, selfish, creative idea can progressively become better with time and patience. 

Thats what progressive means, when you read a few random articles that mentions the specific progressive of these frameworks.  

I experimented with the stupid and suspicious idea of using Excel as a database, and adding frameworks bit by bit, and borrowing code from this repo: 

https://github.com/AnthonyDjogan/Excel-Based-Employee-Management-System_Python-CRUD-Application/blob/main/Employee_Management_CRUD.py

And then progressively organizing and splitting code and CRUD in my own way. It works. Hahaha...

   RIP Dashboards: 5 Psychology Hacks to Stop Your Work from Dying

You spent weeks building it.
Stakeholders said, “Looks great!”

And then… silence.

❌ No one opens it.
❌ No decisions.
❌ No impact.

Your work deserves to be used.

Here’s how to make sure your insights don't die 👇

1. The Think-Aloud Protocol
🔹 Stop asking, “Is this useful?”—people don’t know. Instead:
🔹 Hand them the dashboard. Let them talk out loud as they explore. 
🔹 Watch where they click, pause, and get stuck — this reveals problems.

💡 Usability expert Jakob Nielsen: 
“Users will never tell you what’s wrong. But they’ll show you.”

2. The IKEA Effect
🔹 Ask early: “What do you think?”
🔹 Show them drafts, not just the final version.
🔹 Let them tweak a few things—it makes them feel ownership.

💡 The more they’re involved, the more they’ll use it.

3. Design Thinking: Build for How They Work (Not What They Ask For)
🔹 Watch how they work today—where’s the friction?
🔹 Prototype early. Refine fast. 
🔹 Don’t spend weeks working on the wrong thing.

💡 If they struggle to use it, it’s not them—it’s the design.

4. Hick’s Law: Simplify or Die
🔹 Cut 20% of elements right now.
🔹 Highlight one key insight they should act on.
🔹 Pre-set defaults instead of making them tweak everything.

💡 Less friction = faster decisions.

5. The “Last Mile” Problem: Put Insights Where They’ll Be Seen
🔹 Push critical insights where people already work (Slack, email, CRM).
🔹 Example: Sales gets an alert when revenue drops below target.
🔹 Meet them where they already work, so data doesn’t get ignored.

💡 Make insights part of their workflow, not an extra step.

In short:
- Make it simple.
- Make them part of the process.
- Make sure it drives action.

Ever built something that no one used? 

Make your insights unforgettable with Data Storytelling.

Subject: Response to Domestic Inquiry Intiation
To Whom It May Concern,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing in response to your email regarding the initiation of domestic inquiry, scheduled for 9:30am 5th March.

I would like to confirm my attendance at the domestic inquiry and assure you that I will be present as requested. I understand the importance of this matter and am fully prepared to provide any necessary information or clarification.

I would like to know if it is possible for Lukman Hakim and Farahin to attend the inquiry as witnesses. I would also like to know the procedure in bringing in a witness, and if am I allowed to call/contact the witness before the inquiry in any way, as well as how early will HR inform the witness. 

Thank you for the opportunity to address this matter, and I look forward to meeting with you.

*** how to create a jar file:
#+begin_quote

jar cvfm .\sw_core.vertx.ardie.1.jar manifest.txt .\sw_core.vertx.1.jar.src\

#+end_quote
*** this also seems to convert existing jar files, but the result is nested, doesnt seem to work.
**** why is my .jar nested
** TODO

** TODO 
*** important terminologies, Java beginners:
**** make sure you know the usual, inheretence, but also interface
**** what is jars, libraries, modules, packages. Whats the difference between aall this
**** what is an osgi bundle
**** what is annotation
**** getting familiar with manifest.mf is very useful. 
** TODO 
*** write how javac is recursive
*** playing with javac classpath is REALLY annoying!!
** TODO 
*** im pretty sure it  will be really cool when we master async vs sync understanding. anyway heres a [[https://pwrteams.com/content-hub/blog/async-programming-and-completablefuture-in-java#par2][link]]

*** write how network cn also cause confusion. (Maven has to download from plugins based on ur pom.xml)
*** write how from Java is difficult, mostly becoz of path issues and libraries, these are not considered coding skill issue. Proficient programmers who have no experience with Java will struggle A LOT with just paths and library location issues A LOT. This is nothing to be ashamed of.
** Write this sommewhere, especially that multiple member of an object  (last part). Javais not always obvious.

*** Java common errors:
**** Dealing package naming problems, and such related errors, will become VERY common for the beginner Java developer. As you are leaarning, you will encounter many of these types of errors.
**** **** Error: Missing interoperability module javajsonitem
***** there are invalid spaces in the manifest.mf
**** unresolved requirement
#+begin_quote

org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Could not resolve module: javajsonitem [967]
  Unresolved requirement: Import-Package: com.fasterxml

#+end_quote
***** wrong naming of package in Import-Package (manifest.mf)
**** When reading an error, you get an exception:
***** .\java_json_item.java:126: error: unreported exception MalformedURLException; must be caught or declared to be thrown
***** Solution: import java.io.*;
***** add throws IOException to method declaration
#+begin_quote

 public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
    

#+end_quote
**** Java package related problems (package does not exist) are VERY common problems, and can disrupt your ability to learn Java. Its always best to  keep   your work structure simple, or take the time to learn Maven, or CLI tools (whicher tool works for u)

*** GIS maintains a single of truth for utilities
*** https://geospatialworld.net/article/gis-maintains-a-single-source-of-truth-for-utilities/
*** GIS had entered the utility enterprise simply as a system for automating map production, but has now evolved into a core-enabling technology. Why is CAD-GIS integration important in a utilities project?
*** Bentley Map leverages the powerful 3D capabilities of microstation
*** Water utilities use variables/parameters like pipe break data, year installed, material, neighbourhood, - to prioritize pipe renewal
**** Does electrical utilities do the same thing.

* Piano (no social media progress)
** You need to buy a stand
** Post on FB after its done (things that happened):
*** Write about piano, how theres a strong argument to be made of how the only people who like Schoenberg of deluded elitists. True snobs, who fail to look inside themselves. And there are plenty of serious musicians who dont get or even dislike Schoenberg. Turns out I also hate Schoenberg. Also write something about comparing Scriabin and Schoenberg.

*** Guy who knows about ergonomical split keyboards, presents a study (Masters? PhD?  something else?). And absolutely impressed the judges. I  even  feel  amazing his success on Reddit. People dont know that ergo-keyboards literally reduce injuries and  pain (pre-existing or  otherwise). [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1h7r6de/just_finished_my_thesis][Link]]
*** Amos Yee, I dont know anything about him, and only remember him from a YouTube video where he mocked Lee Kuan Yee and Islam. Never was particularly offended, obviously. But then I saw ShoeOnHeads response to  his video defending pedophiles. I searched his name on Google. Interesting results, most English-language results highlighted his child sex case, while most Bahasa Melayu results highlight his criticism of religion. (In fact, one Bahasa article only mentioned his child sex case at the VERY end). Even after decades of sacrifice, Malaysians still like their pedophiles. Holy shit, just thinking about that, makes me want to assassinate an random Ulamak.

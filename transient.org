Freelancer Brief: Beginner-Friendly ImageMagick Script for Product Artwork Overlays
Hi! I need help creating a super simple script using ImageMagick that can overlay artwork onto product images.

⚠️ Please note: I am not technical and have never used ImageMagick or scripts before. I typically just work by copy-pasting screenshots of products (like mugs) into a folder, and I want to apply artwork to those images without breaking or changing anything else.

🖼️ My Typical Workflow
I copy or screenshot multiple product photos (e.g., mugs) into a folder on my computer.

These are usually JPG or PNG files of real products, with the photo background included.

I want to add surface artwork (like a logo or graphic) to each product photo, without altering anything else in the image.

🧱 Folder Setup (What You'll Work With)
css
Copy
Edit
/input/     → the folder with screenshots or product photos (e.g., mug1.jpg, mug2.jpg)
/artwork/   → a single transparent PNG I want to overlay (e.g., logo.png)
/output/    → a folder where I want the new images saved
🎯 What I Need the Script to Do
Batch process all the images in /input/

Overlay the same artwork file (from /artwork/logo.png) onto each image

Place the artwork in a fixed position (e.g., centered, or at X/Y coordinates I can change easily)

Save the new images in /output/ without overwriting the originals
→ Example: mug1_art.jpg, mug2_art.jpg

🔒 What the Script Must NOT Do
Do NOT change the product image’s size, shape, lighting, color, resolution, or angle

Do NOT touch or alter the background

Do NOT re-render, distort, or filter the photo in any way

Only the new artwork should be added—everything else must stay visually identical

✅ What I Need from You
A working script for Mac (.sh) or Windows (.bat)—please let me know which one

Step-by-step instructions on how to install ImageMagick (for someone who has never done it)

Clear directions on how to run the script, like copy-paste commands I can follow

Comments in the script so I understand what each part does

Optional: allow me to easily tweak the artwork size or position

💬 I’ll gladly answer any questions—but please assume I have zero coding or design experience, and that I’m just working with basic screenshots and PNG files.


Would you be able to help me build this?

Let me know if you’d like me to prepare this as a downloadable text or Word document for posting!

*** our member-front page needs a reload check
*** when a member deletes an event, it should also appropriate descendents => FormQuestionAnswers, and also refill FormQuestionAnswersDeleted, think of recalling the same function
*** we need to do element ebhaviour for subgroups as well
*** a link beside form-creator, or tooltip that suggests ideas for fieldnames
*** we need to disable disable add buttons on subgroup leading question. Also need to disable values when subgroup button is selected (although it doesnt really matter)
*** rename #tournament_name as someting very unique, its too generic, OR remove all IDs from form-template elements, since that is not used
*** check that overwritten submissions gets carried into File model, and file sumission stores minutes and hours of day. And also, that 
*** IMPORTANT: check multiple file inputs and see the effect of log in form_submission()
*** we should put "storage", root path of uploads, into a global var
*** we should check ALL checkboxes input, including our downloader
*** we should write this somewhere. Jinja when looping through dict, has NO "awareness" of dict structure by default hence has to resort to jinja tricks like these:
#+begin_export web

    {% if loop.first %}

	{% for fieldname,answer in membersAnswer.items() %}
	    {% if answer.subgroupId is none %}

*** UI: we need to limit the subgroup creation (leadingquestion) to radio only, UI level constraint 
*** we need to put in element form creator, checks for "-" for empty text box default values

*** when memebrs answer fhe same form again, it overwrites. we havent done that yet
*** questionString or questionstring??
*** file input in template and subgroup-template
*** we need more tooltips, for subgroup creator too
*** we need to rename model data member "type" to something else
*** withdraw event, clause to warn no refund. 50% refund. 0% refund.
*** rather than terminating event completely on closing date, we warn/info user on closing date
*** the type, eligibility, important, can be put at top of form or dropdown display
*** create kill all form button that will kill altogether eventFormQuestions, eventFormQuestionAnaswers, and eventFormQuestionSubgroup
*** our admin doesnt session timeout

*** for our form creator:
**** our forms will have expire date, Terry will have to personally manage late expcetions if he wants.
*** for kill_event, we need to replace render_template with redirect
*** we should have a dummy page.
*** we should have a form preview at a separate page
** Tests:
*** Put some tests in case of wrongly named CSV files
*** kill event should successfully kill all event descendent data
**** create event
**** create form questions with sub questions
**** get 2 members to register for event and fill form
**** get 1 member to register for event ONLY
**** get 1st memebr to register again
**** KILL event
**** check event, eventmember, formquestion, formquestionsubgroup, formquestionanswers, formquestionanswersdeleted of specific event ID are deleted
*** Test form link when there is no matching event, or no event entirely
*** Insert the exact same name for tournament name, make sure it catches error properly, shoulfd show DB level error message
*** Go thrhough the usual uplaod of Jan Feb and March, check messages
*** Upload Jan Feb March, and try uploading FRL in Feb, it should fail wih "wrong type"
*** Uplaod Jan Feb march, and try updating FRL in Feb, it should correctly updated FIDE. Check 1 members to confirm

** Social media posting:
*** Post again your 
*** Managing 2 Emacs version (28 and 29 in my case) minimally, not much fancy hack.
*** My Noevim-killer setup. No, Ive got nothing againt Vim or Neovim, and I did not set out to create a Vim-binding alternative, but it feels so ergonomic, it might as well as be. However, I mostly combined this with some unique hacky modifications of my own keyboard, as well as my usage of both sides of Ctrl and Alt. So they might not work for your setup. One of the complaints I hear all the time from YouTubers who are pro Neovim are Emacs pinky's, which is the result of Emacs over-reliance on modifiers like Alt and Ctrl. Ive used Emacs for less than 10 years, so unlike others, I personally feel less attached if Emacs in the future decides to change some default keybindings. Theres always a workarond, by having a "classic bindings". Anyway, long story short, here are some of the clever tricks that I came up with in my journey to a more ergonomic Vim-binding alternative in Emacs:
**** Completely rewire how I use my my keyboard. This ones more like "hardwired" hack. Basically, I always use both hands, and as little pinky as possible. When I am pressing Ctrl-w, instead of using Left hand for both Ctrl and W, I use Right hand for Ctrl and Left hand for w.
**** I experimented with Hydra mode as much as possible. Using Hydra mode, I map shortcuts like ;;t to a Personal learning Diary, and ;;p to my Python Diary, and there are 24 more alphabets to go. If I were to ever code in C or C++, I could remap those modes to exclusively not use those.
**** I use a rather less-known package called Key Chord. Using key chords, I create a directional bigram, that is highly ergonomic. I will explain this in a later post, but simply, instead of Ctrl-_ for Undo, I use qw for Undo, since qw is a key combination rarely used in writing (aka bigram). Since qw is placed on the left (aka directional), left hints on "going back", since its our natural reading direction. These directional key presses are a theme I apply throughout (]\ for opening empty scratch buffer on the right, p[ is for moving to opened window on the right, and [] for moving to opened window on the left, zx for moving to previous buffer, and ,. for moving to next buffer). 
**** I paste small Velcro pieces on all my keyboard modifiers, such as Ctrl and Alt with braille-inspired variations, so I can literally just feel the Alt and Ctrl. Similarly applied to by directional bigram key chords. In my current workflow, I no longer look at the keys for Ctrl or Alt, and this braille addition makes my navigation many times more ergonomic.
**** Thats it, so far, my only complain is this Velcro addition makes my keyboard look ugly, my next move might be to epoxy necklace beads to my keyboards for those braille-inspired patterns. Yes its very hacky, but its better than carrying a very bulky mechnical keyboard everywhere with me.
**** References: [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/key-chord][Key Chords]] and [[https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/02/01/rare-bigrams/][bigrams]]
**** Well, its either this or a very expensive split keyboard that is completely out of my reach.
*** Things I learnt from the book UNIX-haters.  So many, but the few things that were useful to me:
**** Commands like rm, cp, are badly designed due to cryptic naming (2-letter word), inconsistent documentation (beginning users learn are told to use "man <command>", but many commands dont have man, such as fg, jobs, set). 
**** UNIX does not respect many forms of boundaries such as files, even though everything is supposedly a file in UNIX philosophy, many UNIX commands (some are carried forward over to Linux) easily overwrites files, when used wrongly (and mistakes are very easy to make in UNIX, even for sys-admins). So I made tinkered my Emacs to force myself to chane my habit. Actually not "force", I ensured Emacs navigation was more comfortable thn navigating using cd commands or removing files using rm command. I dont want to use aliases for rm, so I dont forget just how dangerous the rm command is. 
**** In Emacs Dired (the file manager of Emacs), I replaced <enter> and ^ with Alt-<right> and Alt-<left>. more comfortable than a terminal. And I defined the variable trash-directory so that deleting a file gets moved to a trashcan first, like other operating system's. The usual delete commands in Emacs Dired are already comfortable
**** Some of the bad design elements were also due to "market constraint". There was millitary funding of UNIX development at University of Berkeley. And you had to please millitary general requirements or maybe just contraints. Which is proof that most of techs history is closely related "culture and art" than it is to something rational and logical. And UNIX has infested everywhere at our current time.
**** OSI model (of the network) sucks. Despite what people in tech make you think, tech is more art than science. Nothing wrong with that, but its a messy art. OSI are created by "standard makers", but just like the guys who libraries for programming, the guys who write the standards are usually not the same guys who use the standard. People who use UNIX's sendmail at the time (also a horrible tool) also complain about OSI
*** Diary in Emacs, perhaps the best way to learn Emacs selfishly:
**** So its me back, and im back with more "what I do with my Emacs". Some of the previous points last time, was integrating org-mode with Obsidian markdown files, so I can read everything I write in Emacs on my tablet, using the fancy Obsidian.
**** I also mentioned in passing my org note setup. However, I wanna try to focus on writing a diary in Emacs, as well as some features that might be attractive to some of you, but I dont use personally. My way of learning Emacs during my early years, is to steal a little of time everyday to write a diary in Emacs.
**** Why write a diary? Well for one, the human mind has a very abstract understanding of time. With regards to skil for example, im sure many of us have spent countless hours, even thousands of hours, learning a particular difficult skill, a football trick, a juggling trick, painting, a musical piece. This is not to mention solving a software skill, that is seemingly easy to understand but difficult to execute at as a junior. Writing a diary serves as a log of progress. If we spend so much time looking at computer code, why we cant we do the same with the most important software and hardware, our brain? Its not about optimizing for progress sake, but for mental health, so write in your diary your accomplishment in side projects or hobbies. You are more than just the value of what corporates give you. Make the technology you use serve you side passions too. Dont lose sight of the goal, technology is supposed to make your life easier not harder.
**** Using a diary, you can split further your learning experience into Emacs and non-Emacs stuff. Eventually, you will reach an Emacs level, where you create not just shortcuts, but overpowered shortcuts that map to everything else, your Python notes, your current project, your favourite shell script, a shortcut that triggers a simple backup script, anything (we are not talking about running a script from the IDE, but rather mapping Ctrl-c Ctrl-g or whatever). But reaching there, like every other skill takes time. Use Emacs to learn Emacs, TODO lists, reminders, notes. Cheat your boss by including 30 minutes of Emacs reading. 
**** there are many parts to explore. Actually the best thing to explore about Emacs which is org-mode. Its everything, a knowledge management system, a TODO organizer, a diary, a daily reminder, a timer, you name it, org-mode has it. Use Org-Mode as part of this "cheat" routine. Eventually, Org-Mode will make your life and work easier, but its one of those of things where you will never be able to convince your boss or colleague, it has so many advantages yet difficult to communicate to others. Forget an employer, even explaining to a friend is a struggle.
**** yes, in a sense, Im using this as an excuse to advertize Emacs as an alternative. However, this comes with a warning. In short, if you want a software that has "opinions" on the best way to do things, this is not for you. Emacs is dangerous in a sense it has 0 opinions on the best way things. On top of that, you are not going to learn things in a month or 2, it is a real invesment.
**** But Im gonna end this on a good note, eventually everything will turn out fine. The community is there r/emacs on Reddit, SachaChua, Xah Lee, SystemCrafters, Protesilaos. Some of these guys are not coders.

*** https://imagekit.io/blog/how-to-upload-files-in-html/
** The best way to read CSS frameworks, while learning an actual project in your real work, while also spending time doing your personal project, is to read all the documentation of several. Im currently reading both Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. The frameworks come from different perspectives and opinions. And trying to get into the mind fo the guys who created the "language", means trying to think "what is the creator trying to convey", when reading all their documentations. 
** We are going to publish our site, either in render or fly.io

** Reading
*** [[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2053842][Japanese anti-monopoly law]]
** Emacs:
*** Also, finish this somewhere, about starting, and its not that simple, becoz things go wrong, Emacs tends to hide it, when use the usual shell-command, so instead, your UNIT OF ABSTRACTION must be the process:
**** http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/elisp_start_external_process.html
*** Convincing others:
**** Non-destructive ways to test Emacs packages:
***** use the try package. Then do the usual use-package, or any normal config for that package you found online.
*** create a emacs script that calls magick on any dired
*** try perspective el
*** Also try Emacs Application Framework on a new laptop
*** You like trying cool custom personalized Emacs el. This one is useful simpler bookmark, might help a lot in you html editing: [[https://github.com/joodland/bm][here]]

*** we need another Hydra to ehsily go to other-window using (other-window 1)
*** [[https://zck.org/define-keymap][keymap]] very cool stuff
*** web-mode-element-wrap must be hydra-ed. We also need to auto-select a whole delimiter. But first try the stackoverflow templating engine trick.
*** We need to learn this Emacs [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/23810/getting-proper-indentation-for-python-flask-templates][templating indent]] mode thingy
*** we are going to try to use enriched mode to color Emacs
** Store this cool [[https://www.andrewvillazon.com/move-data-to-db-with-sqlalchemy/][declarative_base]] link, coz we managed to make it work for bulk upload. Note how you dont need to remove your usual model in your class. The declarative_model simply maps your class with the existing table.
** override modus theme, a masterpiece theme according to 1 guy, into a [[https://github.com/idlip/haki/tree/haki][high contrast tasheme]]

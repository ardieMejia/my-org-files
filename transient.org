* Reminder
** Remember what Chomsky said
*** societies ban certain discussions on purpose to  keep the illusion  of freedom of discussion going. 
*** Most reporters worth their salt, take their job as a mostly a joke. They know the illusion of freedom of speech
*** remember, you made the FUCKING d minor prelude??
* What to do today:
** Spokeshave:
*** The first photo you see is my own handmade spokeshave. The second photo you see is 1 from Carousell, is rusted, and he's selling at RM 45 (jacked up from RM 35). One of the problem with the returning popularity of handtools in woodworking/carpenting, is that there are sellers taking advantage of nostalgic buyers. Nostalgic buyers buy anything that is nostalgic at a high price, based on vibe. If sellers keep doing this, that means such buyers are  more common than I think.
*** This wouldnt be a problem, except for several facts: (1) Some of these buyers would not do this a decade ago, before Instagram woodworkers got really big, where the price of this items would sell literally at snack prices (I heard comon stories in USA garage sales or UK car boot sales, people selling this stuff at the equivalent of RM 1-5) (2) My own tool (1st photo) works many times better than a newly bought spokeshave, refining a spokeshave takes effort and skill (3) Restoring a rusted tool is doubly the effort, it takes a patience, time and skill to do this, not to mention looking for the paint for the spokeshave body.
*** Im not complaining really. Just trying to emphasize the fact the market value of something has more to do with perceived value of something. Very similar to the relationship of investors and businesses. If Mark Zuckerberg were discovered to have sexually assaulted a women in the past, and successfully charged in court (actually Elon Musk almost got caught in a case involving sexual charges, but nothing happened), Facebook would lose market value like magic. 
*** Market value is perceived more than anything. A smaller percentage of it could be attributed to actual quality.
*** I still love the influence of Instagram on hobbies. But this is ridiculus. This is why the upcycle market is mostly a scam, and the entire dynamic will never encourage people to actually upcycle. Is the money important? If its important, then stop pretending its not important. Is the upcycling more important? Then why punish the upcyclers/buyers with ridiculus prices? Coupled this fact with some upcycled wood businesses propping up like mushrooms, trying to feed on the demand, and there might be no way to tell if its upcycled or cut from fresh trees. Which means the upcycling sentiment was not important after all. 
*** By the way, my spokeshave feels its like worth RM 300 in effort alone (not including material). Shaves wood like butter. And uses old parts of furniture.

*** I know some of you are not particular attached to the idea of writing for your own personal sake. In our world, the code itself is documentation. But I can never help feel childish and selfish when it comes to having something personal to write on. I have a personal diary which I write on my favourite piece of software. I find that it helps even when it comes to small stuff (like installing a piece of software, or creating a new repo). I find that it personally helps me with my personal hobbies too (as I have trouble separating between professional work and passionate side project). What setup do you guys have that helps with dealing with the complexity that comes with this job (and the complexity that comes from dealing with separating professional like and side projects). A diary? A knowledge manage system like Obsidian?
** Write about the concept of traceback and dump() and dump(obj)
** Post on LinkIn, you dontactually need a big project to practice using frameworks. Just start with a very simple selfish, even stupid idea. Many of the modern frameworks we have out there are quite progressive, meaning as long as you have some idea of good code organization, your stupid ( and big and creative) idea can be made gradually better. Dont be intimidated by all the naysayers out there. Or maybe that only happened to me. But frameworks can be applied gradually to your creative idea. So I tried it with the stupid idea of using Excel as a data base using this REPO as a base. It works, I carefully replace with little bits of Flask here and there.
#+begin_quote

You dont actually need to treat web frameworks with fear. I just only learnt this. Modern frameworks are quite progressive in their nature. This means as long as you have some idea of good code organization and abstraction. Your random, stupid, selfish, creative idea can progressively become better with time and patience. 

Thats what progressive means, when you read a few random articles that mentions the specific progressive of these frameworks.  

I experimented with the stupid and suspicious idea of using Excel as a database, and adding frameworks bit by bit, and borrowing code from this repo: 

https://github.com/AnthonyDjogan/Excel-Based-Employee-Management-System_Python-CRUD-Application/blob/main/Employee_Management_CRUD.py

And then progressively organizing and splitting code and CRUD in my own way. It works. Hahaha...

*** Dont be ashamed to be admit that it takes a long time to learn a certain computer technology/language/framework. Even several years. Computer programming concepts for example are built on top of layers of abstraction. And the more the abstraction, the more mental effort it requires. A beginner Python programmer for example, cant tell the difference between modules and folders. And its useful for him/her to think in terms of physical folders for a long amount of time.

   RIP Dashboards: 5 Psychology Hacks to Stop Your Work from Dying

You spent weeks building it.
Stakeholders said, “Looks great!”

And then… silence.

❌ No one opens it.
❌ No decisions.
❌ No impact.

Your work deserves to be used.

Here’s how to make sure your insights don't die 👇

1. The Think-Aloud Protocol
🔹 Stop asking, “Is this useful?”—people don’t know. Instead:
🔹 Hand them the dashboard. Let them talk out loud as they explore. 
🔹 Watch where they click, pause, and get stuck — this reveals problems.

💡 Usability expert Jakob Nielsen: 
“Users will never tell you what’s wrong. But they’ll show you.”

2. The IKEA Effect
🔹 Ask early: “What do you think?”
🔹 Show them drafts, not just the final version.
🔹 Let them tweak a few things—it makes them feel ownership.

💡 The more they’re involved, the more they’ll use it.

3. Design Thinking: Build for How They Work (Not What They Ask For)
🔹 Watch how they work today—where’s the friction?
🔹 Prototype early. Refine fast. 
🔹 Don’t spend weeks working on the wrong thing.

💡 If they struggle to use it, it’s not them—it’s the design.

4. Hick’s Law: Simplify or Die
🔹 Cut 20% of elements right now.
🔹 Highlight one key insight they should act on.
🔹 Pre-set defaults instead of making them tweak everything.

💡 Less friction = faster decisions.

5. The “Last Mile” Problem: Put Insights Where They’ll Be Seen
🔹 Push critical insights where people already work (Slack, email, CRM).
🔹 Example: Sales gets an alert when revenue drops below target.
🔹 Meet them where they already work, so data doesn’t get ignored.

💡 Make insights part of their workflow, not an extra step.

In short:
- Make it simple.
- Make them part of the process.
- Make sure it drives action.

Ever built something that no one used?

Subject: Response to Domestic Inquiry Intiation
To Whom It May Concern,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing in response to your email regarding the initiation of domestic inquiry, scheduled for 9:30am 5th March.

I would like to confirm my attendance at the domestic inquiry and assure you that I will be present as requested. I understand the importance of this matter and am fully prepared to provide any necessary information or clarification.

I would like to know if it is possible for Lukman Hakim and Farahin to attend the inquiry as witnesses. I would also like to know the procedure in bringing in a witness, and if am I allowed to call/contact the witness before the inquiry in any way, as well as how early will HR inform the witness. 

Thank you for the opportunity to address this matter, and I look forward to meeting with you.

Sincerely,
Wan Ahmad Ardie

   RIP Dashboards: 5 Psychology Hacks to Stop Your Work from Dying

You spent weeks building it.
Stakeholders said, “Looks great!”

And then… silence.

❌ No one opens it.
❌ No decisions.
❌ No impact.

Your work deserves to be used.

Here’s how to make sure your insights don't die 👇

1. The Think-Aloud Protocol
🔹 Stop asking, “Is this useful?”—people don’t know. Instead:
🔹 Hand them the dashboard. Let them talk out loud as they explore. 
🔹 Watch where they click, pause, and get stuck — this reveals problems.

💡 Usability expert Jakob Nielsen: 
“Users will never tell you what’s wrong. But they’ll show you.”

2. The IKEA Effect
🔹 Ask early: “What do you think?”
🔹 Show them drafts, not just the final version.
🔹 Let them tweak a few things—it makes them feel ownership.

💡 The more they’re involved, the more they’ll use it.

3. Design Thinking: Build for How They Work (Not What They Ask For)
🔹 Watch how they work today—where’s the friction?
🔹 Prototype early. Refine fast. 
🔹 Don’t spend weeks working on the wrong thing.

💡 If they struggle to use it, it’s not them—it’s the design.

4. Hick’s Law: Simplify or Die
🔹 Cut 20% of elements right now.
🔹 Highlight one key insight they should act on.
🔹 Pre-set defaults instead of making them tweak everything.

💡 Less friction = faster decisions.

5. The “Last Mile” Problem: Put Insights Where They’ll Be Seen
🔹 Push critical insights where people already work (Slack, email, CRM).
🔹 Example: Sales gets an alert when revenue drops below target.
🔹 Meet them where they already work, so data doesn’t get ignored.

💡 Make insights part of their workflow, not an extra step.

In short:
- Make it simple.
- Make them part of the process.
- Make sure it drives action.

Ever built something that no one used?

*** Guy who knows about ergonomical split keyboards, presents a study (Masters? PhD?  something else?). And absolutely impressed the judges. I  even  feel  amazing his success on Reddit.

*** Amos Yee, I dont know anything about him, and only remember him from a YouTube video where he mocked Lee Kuan Yee and Islam. Never was particularly offended, obviously. But then I saw ShoeOnHeads response to  his video defending pedophiles. I searched his name on Google. Interesting results, most English-language results highlighted his child sex case, while most Bahasa Melayu results highlight his criticism of religion. (In fact, one Bahasa article only mentioned his child sex case at the VERY end). Even after decades of sacrifice, Malaysians still like their pedophiles. Holy shit, just thinking about that, makes me want to assassinate an random Ulamak.

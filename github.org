* Setting up new ssh key on a system
** After git init-ing of a folder. You can compare pushing to https to pushing to ssh directly.
** Make changes, commit, then push (with username and password, of course)
** Now, change https url, to ssh url
*** git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<myname>/<reponame>.git
*** compare changes before and after (git remote -v)
** Following examples can be gotten from https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
** Command --> ssh-keygen (plain and simple)
*** But.. we should be using new algorithm --> -t ed25519
*** So for github we need this --> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "wan_ahmad_ardie@yahoo.com"
*** Just enter a password, makes it more secure
*** Copy the public key to your Github account (unlike passwords, each new system needs a new pair, better security)
*** Before putting these in .bashrc, try running it first
**** This should make re-entering passphrase no long necessary
**** eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
**** ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 (add the new ssh file, the private one)
****
* Hugo:
** What we learnt most importantly, that both index.md and _index.md cannot co-exist (Better not)
** If all is confusing, always start with no index.md at all at top level. And then copy 1 .md file to top _index.md
** index.md is read blindly by Hugo, but _index.md is processed. So be careful with _index.md (But I managed to make it work)
** hugo by default doesnt publish to /public by default. Needs a switch for that.
* Git submodule:
** Useful intro from scratch

* When doing stuff the way I do, with "unrelated history", do this:

* This is important to do later, for you Kaushal Modi mods:

* Create a web application for a simple live messaging using Laravel 5.* framework. The live messaging application can be opened in two different browsers and both windows can send and receive text messages, without refreshing the page.

    Use your preferred method (Socket.io, Long-Polling, Ajax, etc.) for getting & sending live data
    Messages should be sent, and appear on the page without a page refresh
    All messages are saved into MYSQL database
    Bonus: Upload the project to a server and send us a link to test (preferably on AWS, if free-tier eligible)
    Upload the project onto a public GitHub and send us the repository link.

* Configuration!!
** First video, very cool vibe

* Wish-list (low-profile & quiet) (Gaeteron Low-Profile Red):
** Very cool, very good-looking (one guy loves it 10/10)
*** https://nuphy.com/products/air75
** Keychron has so many cool ones, but I want the low profile one!!
*** https://www.keychron.com/e
*** We changed our mind slightly, Keychron is cool, but it has "almost" there factor. Apparently, people have something to  complain  about  this. But its stiill better than the competitor
* Recommendations:
** Quiet mechanical keyboards!!

** [[https://en.akkogear.com/faq/how-do-i-enter-bootloader-mode-and-flash-the-firmware-on-my-top-40/][Apparently, there are (usually cheap) mech keybs with no QMK firmware]]

*** Download and open QMK Toolbox
*** locate the firmware (and the appropriate .bin)
*** enter into Bootloader mode, and click "Flash" to start firmware flashing
* QMK configurations, QMK port projects for non-QMK keyboards:

** Some good reddit comments on non-QMK keyboard hacks

* Switches, switches, switches:
** Gateron, very special and under-rated:

**** Just like Cherry MX. Red, Brown and Blue from noisiest to quietest
**** Unlike Cherry MX. Clear is super light and linear
**** Silent options at the bottom
**** More fancy ones like milk, giving ur RGB subdued lighting
**** And slightly more expensive Ink, with a smoky tint. Fancy!!
**** And finally, SILENT, also same ranking. From LOUDEST to shhhh... Blue, Brown & Blue

*** things u need
**** WordPress - free
**** WordPress theme - free
**** Web hosting - 100$ a year
**** domain name (basically your URl) - 10-15$ a year
*** Steps:
**** Register domain name
**** Setup web hosting for ur site
**** Point your domain name to ur web hosting accout
**** setup site images
**** install WordPress on web hosting account
**** begin building responsive layouts
*** His guide:
**** Hes got project files
**** tip -> domain name registration and web hosting company, best be separate
**** web hosting companies also offer free domain names
***** this is why we separate, (even if the domain name is free)
***** some horror stories, the domain names "owned" by the web hosting co.
**** To point to ur domain name to web hosting, (its a skill)
***** usually some "admin accound panel"
***** relogging into Web Hosting HUB -> Account Technical Details -> check Nameserver1 & Nameserver2 (Eg "ns1.webhosting.com")
***** In ur domain name co. -> under your domain name item -> look for "nameservers" -> insert custom DNS (our "ns1.webhosting.com")
**** The image he resized was mostly to practice with WordPress
***** moving to our web hosting co. We look for cPanel (apparently this is common for other co. Explains Fiverr)
***** We need to install WordPress -> can choose directory to install WP -> he chose empty, meaning root -> itll be invisible Eg: /dir/ will be tentesting.com/
***** You need a login username & pass (this is WP inside ur web host)
***** He unchecked all plugins (WPforms and all)
***** Once all done. tentesting.com shows default boring WordPress site. And tentesting/com/wp-admin shows WP dashboard
* Tables in Wordpress
** editable table in WordPress, using wpDataTables
*** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhG1ca3FalA
**** import csv or excel file
**** interactive table
**** edit .csv file immediately reflected in frontend table
**** makes it slow
**** therefore better to use wpDataTable constructor
*** https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-table-plugins
**** Interactive tables are painful to build, importing files with thousands data points, and to add formatting, nightmare!!
**** This is not even responsive design yet! (mobile friendliness)
**** WordPress has plugins that can help
**** Plugins (most are almost the same):
***** wpDataTables
***** Ninja Tables
***** TablePress (very cheap, with great data filtering out of the box)
***** WP Table Builder
***** Visualizer (also a table and graphs manager. Created by

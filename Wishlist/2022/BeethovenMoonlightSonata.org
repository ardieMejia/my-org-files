* Things that will not work (yet?):
** Chordal pattern, like Chopins E minor thing
** Major section that is sped up meant as an interruption
** 1-to-1 chromatic displacement
** AVOID introduction of theme, instead attempt an introduction of familiarity in later passages
* Potential ideas:
** Chopins idea of temporal balance. instead of changing tempo of accented notes, fill in (or remove) others as a balancer
** May work but only for intro, instead of repeating those accented notes, change into a different point in the appreggio
** Let us try our "snare" mimic experiment

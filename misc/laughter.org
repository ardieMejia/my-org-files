* Intro
** Hello everyone, my name is Wan Ardie. While I often like to boast in my online persona, I am actually quite awkward in real life. It is the armor that I put up to scare potential enemies. Yes I know, this group is suppose to be making unexpected friendship, but I always keep a consistent level of suspicion with everyone I meet. Anyway for the fun stuff:
*** Interest: music, sci-fi, reading, playing the piano
*** Hobbies: handtools only woodworking
*** A serious fan of hardcore sci-fi: Peter F Hamilton, Alistair Reynolds, Iain Banks, Stephen Baxter
*** I especially like meeting characters of people that contradict me on a deeper level
*** Favourite food: I dont discriminate but esp. homemade stuff = my curry, my baking
*** Toys: Lego
*** Sports: Cycling

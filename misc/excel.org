* Powershell Excel module:
** https://adamtheautomator.com/powershell-excel-tutorial/ Installation
** https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/introducing-the-powershell-excel-module-2/
** 
* Basic and useful and it WORKS!!
** Once we create the Developers tab in the ribbon (Excel), we can click Visual Basic under that tab, and when we click run, we autotimcally register a macro, so we can insert the  following to disable "prompt save on exit"
#+begin_quote

Sub test1()
ActiveWorkbook.Close SaveChanges:=False
End Sub


#+end_quote
*** We can then attach this to a shortcut so  easy to exit without saving!!
** More rearranging tricks (always good idea to stick use keyboard shortcuts and not fully automate columns, becoz we get to see and check the changes ourselves)
**
#+begin_quote


Sub arrange_1()

    Range("A1", Range("P200").End(xlDown)).Sort Key1:=Range("D1"), Order1:=xlAscending, Header:=xlYes

End Sub


#+end_quote
** Delete text that DOESNT contain a pattern, sometimes better to avoid selection completely (according to one website), but I disagree completely
#+begin_quote

Sub delete_1()

    
    Dim lastRow As Long

     lastRow = Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row
     For i = lastRow To 1 Step -1
       If InStr(1, Cells(i, "D").Value, "SLGT", vbTextCompare) = 0 Then
         Rows(i).EntireRow.Delete
       End If
     Next


End Sub


#+end_quote

* Syntax (I hope I still hate Python):
** [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm][tutorialspoint]]
*** so Python has concepts such as tuples and list, which are fundamentally different, as in tuples are unchangeable
**** Sounds like a fundamentally bad idea, since building a skillset around functions that CRUD lists, and tuples will be confusing
**** or maybe not
*** So its always a good idea to focus only on list, when learning Python
** [[https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary][programmingiz]]
*** good basic source
*** Some dictionary methods
** [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html][official]]
*** LOTS of examples, though have to try each and everyone
** [[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/11/building-an-infinite-timer-using-python/][probably very cool but Indianish]]
*** Also, mostly a library advert
** [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-string-methods-tutorial-how-to-use-find-and-replace-on-python-strings/][freecodecamp]]
*** freecodecamp -> a classic, but I never liked their "huge-ass font" & weird soydev presentation
* Packages & virtual environment:
** Installation:
*** 2 URLS actually:
**** https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-18.04/
**** https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
** [[https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/][Official python virtual environment management]]
*** Despite all the confusing commands, the only thing you have to understand is this
**** the only tool is required venv (or virtualenv in older Python)
**** pip is just the Python installer (not important)
** IMPORTANT: How to solve the opencv-python error of-- No module named 'skbuild'
*** https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/python-no-module-named-skbuild
* IDE, PyCharm (I really hate Python)
** [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/][I may have no choice but to install PyCharm, it probably works too well]]
*** Maybe #1 reason I hate Python
** [[https://confluence.jetbrains.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=51945983][Change look and feel of PyCharm]]
** disabling PyCharm auto-suggestion (great for those learning Python)
*** Settings -> Editor -> General -> Code Completion -> Tick -- Show suggestions as you type
* Emacs IDE for Python (please God make this work)
* Some basics, still dont like Python BTW:
** Writing text to file, but also has a context manager example
*** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5214578/print-string-to-text-file
* Better file handling, text file handing, path handling!! using pathlib, great for Fiverr clients:
** https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f
* Kinda important:
** Installing Pillow module, the "usual pip way" will produce lots of errors. Instead use this link:
*** https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
* SELF (make sure to write about this IMPORTANT topic later)
** https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/programming/self-variabe-python-examples
** https://www.edureka.co/blog/self-in-python/amp/ (THIS IS A BAD EXPLANATION, dont delete, just point its bad-ness)
** https://medium.com/quick-code/understanding-self-in-python-a3704319e5f0
* Vector (PyGame related)
** zip() function which returns a list of tuples, where the 1st items of the list is paired/grouped together, the 2nd items of the list grouped, etc..
* Python variables:
*** integer
** float variables
*** Python can store float numbers
*** something about floats

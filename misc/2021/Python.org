* Syntax (I hope I still hate Python): 
** [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm][tutorialspoint]]
*** so Python has concepts such as tuples and list, which are fundamentally different, as in tuples are unchangeable
**** Sounds like a fundamentally bad idea, since building a skillset around functions that CRUD lists, and tuples will be confusing
**** or maybe not
*** So its always a good idea to focus only on list, when learning Python
** [[https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary][programmingiz]]
*** good basic source
*** Some dictionary methods
** [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html][official]]
*** LOTS of examples, though have to try each and everyone
** [[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/11/building-an-infinite-timer-using-python/][probably very cool but Indianish]]
*** Also, mostly a library advert
** [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-string-methods-tutorial-how-to-use-find-and-replace-on-python-strings/][freecodecamp]]
*** freecodecamp -> a classic, but I never liked their "huge-ass font" & weird soydev presentation
* Packages & virtual environment:
** [[https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/][Official python virtual environment management]]
*** Despite all the confusing commands, the only thing you have to understand is this
**** the only tool is required venv (or virtualenv in older Python)
**** pip is just the Python installer (not important)
* IDE, maybe non-Emacs (I really hate Python)
** [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/][I may have no choice but to install PyCharm, it probably works too well]]
*** Maybe #1 reason I hate Python
** [[https://confluence.jetbrains.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=51945983][Change look and feel of PyCharm]]
* Emacs IDE for Python (please God make this work)

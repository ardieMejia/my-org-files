* Syntax, variable basics, and using del :
** [[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm][tutorialspoint]]
*** So its always a good idea to focus only on list, when learning Python
*** tuples are confusing, and not even useful in "advanced OOP" uses
** [[https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary][programmingiz]]
*** good basic source
*** Some dictionary methods
** [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html][official]]
*** LOTS of examples, though have to try each and everyone
** [[https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/11/building-an-infinite-timer-using-python/][not sure if its cool]]
*** Also, mostly a library advert
** [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-string-methods-tutorial-how-to-use-find-and-replace-on-python-strings/][freecodecamp]]
*** freecodecamp -> a classic, but I never liked their "huge-ass font" & weird soydev presentation
* Packages & virtual environment:
** Installation:
*** 2 URLS actually:

**** https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
** [[https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/][Official python virtual environment management]]
*** Despite all the confusing commands, the only thing you have to understand is this
**** the only tool is required venv (or virtualenv in older Python)
**** pip is just the Python installer (not important)

* IDE, PyCharm (I really hate Python)
** [[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/][I may have no choice but to install PyCharm, it probably works too well]]
*** Maybe #1 reason I hate Python
** [[https://confluence.jetbrains.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=51945983][Change look and feel of PyCharm]]
** disabling PyCharm auto-suggestion (great for those learning Python)
*** Settings -> Editor -> General -> Code Completion -> Tick -- Show suggestions as you type
* Emacs IDE for Python (please God make this work)
* Python writing to  file:
** Writing text to file, but also has a context manager example

* OOP, PyGame:

*** Childish non-OOP way to avoid Global  keyword, sinnce its quite obviously bad and confusing

*** used it in my PyGame

* Better file handling, text file handing, path handling!! using pathlib, great for Fiverr clients:
** https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f
* Kinda important:
** Installing Pillow module, the "usual pip way" will produce lots of errors. Instead use this link:
*** https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
* SELF (make sure to write about this IMPORTANT topic later)
** https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/programming/self-variabe-python-examples

* Vector (PyGame related)
** zip() function which returns a list of tuples, where the 1st items of the list is paired/grouped together, the 2nd items of the list grouped, etc
* Event handling
** I finally made this code sample work. Detailed below are the mistake I made, which should  be a common mistake
#+begin_quote

class EventWrapper (object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.eventwraps = []
    def __iadd__(self, an_event):
        self.eventwraps.append(an_event)
        return self
    # lets try without the __call__ first
    def __call__(self, *a, **b):
        for an_eventhandler in self.eventwraps:
            an_eventhandler(*a, **b)


class MessageToDisplay(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "whateever"
    def PrintMe(self):
        print("this is an event from inside PrintMe <-- MessageToDisplay")

class a_user(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "a user"
        self.on_event_1 = EventWrapper()

    def the_main_event(self):
        self.on_event_1()

    def add_an_event(self, an_event):
        print("adding")
        self.on_event_1 += an_event # this is from iadd

def Start():
    sample_user = a_user()
    a_printer = MessageToDisplay()
    sample_user.add_an_event(a_printer.PrintMe)
    # sample_user.add_an_event(a_printer.PrintMe())
    # -----  The 2nd is previous line, which produces the error : -----
    #  ----- TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable -----
    # ----- Notice the extra bracket which means we redefining the function, turning it null
    sample_user.on_event_1()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Start()


#+end_quote
** [[https://pypi.org/project/Events/][This]] uses C# style events. But Im guessing its a very common Python  pip download.
#+begin_quote


from events import Events

def something_changed(reason):
    print("soemthing changed because %s" % reason)

events = Events()

events.on_change += something_changed # remember this is kinda cool, becoz event can be ANY function, no need for class

events.on_change("i have diarrhea")

* Arrange:
** https://skymind.ai/wiki/lstm
*** A beginners guide to LSTM's and Recurrent Neural Network. One is (RNN) time dependent, one is not. 
*** The RNN preserves sequential information in the hidden state. 
*** The output of the hidden layer is used as input to the next time step. 
*** The sum of the hidden state and weight is squashed by a funtion (eg. logistic sigmoid function). Because of this feedback loop, each hidden state contains not only of (directly) previous hidden state, but also those before h_t-1 as long as memory cna persist
*** Recurrent nets are old (like most neural network), and major OLD problem is the "vanishing gradient problem"
*** LSTMs are a variation of recurrent net. They help preserve the error that can be propagated through time and layers. By maintaining a more constant error, they allow recurrent nets to continue to learn over many time steps (over 1000)

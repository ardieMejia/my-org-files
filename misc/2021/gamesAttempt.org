** perhaps a cool idea would be to mimic Emacs powerful concept of "modes" then each mode would have its own modifier, Ctl-x opens up

** Matlab concepts "truecolor" and "indexed" color.

*** Understanding inner workings, means understanding DirectClass (continuous tone, stored as RGB as example profile)
*** And understanding innerworkings of PseudoClass (colormapped RGM indexes)
*** So what is a colormap:
**** Basically, from the mathworks site, the concept allows having a separate single array of 3 values (RGB), and in the data (location) section, each pixel has a unique index corresponding to that colormap
*** A simpler way to think of it, is colormaps are more simple-dimensioned. One is 3D array (X*Y*RGB), the other is 2D array (X*Y)index
** Produce grayscale ASCII art from image input

** Take string, and output as colored string

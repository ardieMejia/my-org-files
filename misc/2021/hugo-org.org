** leaf bundles treat non-index .md files as non-entities (no perma-links, no HTML and all), while allowing non-page elements (image, pdf, etc). In essence a folder thats a "leaf bundle" is a whole single entity
** After reading branch bundles, both bundles are nothing special, but simply 'ways of thinking'

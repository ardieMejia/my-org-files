* Introduction:
** Tools:
*** [[https://earthly.dev/blog/autoconf/][Components of Autotools]]  (probably very Linux centric way of making makefiles)
**** Flow?
***** these 3 tools:
****** --autoconf--
****** --automake--
****** --aclocal--
***** Generate (huge files):
****** "configure"
****** "Makefile.in"
***** Those 2 files are huge, so we only create these 2 files, which the tools use to create 2 HUGE files:
****** "configure.ac"
****** "Makefile.am"                      # ---------- the way to remember it is that both have .a* as extension
**** Demo:
***** Interestingly, their demo "Hello World" shows a different argument style unlike [[https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-compile-and-run-c-cplusplus-code-in-linux/][this site]]. Syntax:
#include <stdio.h>

int
main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}
***** Here arguments can be left as (void)
**** autoconf:
***** Interesting to note, is that most options is abbreviate (autoconf to AC, automake to AM). Its also named with capital letters. Which is not my comfort zone.
***** Put exactly like this, in configure.ac:
AC_INIT([helloworld], [0.1], [maintainer@example.com])     # ---------- app name, version, who's maintainer
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE                                           # ---------- automake is USUALLY used alongside automake, but not necessary, so mention this
AC_PROG_CC                                                 # ---------- look for a CC compiler (note how this is not a variable, maybe its called a primary)
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])                                # ---------- this autoconf should look for Makefile.in
AC_OUTPUT                                                  # ---------- output final "configure" script
**** automake:
***** Put like this, in Makefile.am
 AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = foreign                                 # ----------
 bin_PROGRAMS = helloworld                                  # ---------- name of compiled binary (final program)
 helloworld_SOURCES = main.c                                # ---------- required input to compile
**** Finally!! compile:
aclocal                                                    # ---------- run this first
autoconf
automake --add-missing                                     # ---------- -add-missing necessary files, becoz program actually more thans Makefile.am
*** [[https://opensource.com/article/19/7/introduction-gnu-autotools][Similar but different]]
**** Similar but seems more confusing, defines primary "wrongly"?
**** autoconf:
***** same same
**** automake:
***** Example of not building a cPlusPlus project (interpreted languages such Bash, Perl, Python).
bin_SCRIPTS = bin/penguin                                  # ---------- SCRIPT is another primary
*****

**** [[./resources/cPlusPlus/automakeDiagram.png][Basic overview of major autotool components]]
**** autoconf:
AC_PREREQ(2.5)                                              # ---------- apparently, site claims this needed coz autoconf is not compatible between versions
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(1.8)                                       # ---------- site claims automake not compatible between versions, good habit to do both I guess
AC_PROG_CC                                                  # ---------- this is the only thing similar
AC_PROG_INSTALL
AC_PROG_LN_S
AC_PROG_RANLIB
.......... optional ..........
AC_CHECK_PROGS(regex_cmd, sed) if(){...}fi                  # ---------- checks the existance of non-standard apps like 'sed' for example
AC_C_CONST                                                  # ---------- check for compiler features -> can our compiler do const
.......... library and header checks ..........
AC_HEADER_STDC
AC_HEADER_DIRENT
AC_CHECK_HEADERS([stdlib.h stdio.h libintl.h locale.h])
AC_CHECK_LIB(ssl, SSL_free)
.......... and several others ..........

*** [[https://makefiletutorial.com/][Simple Makefile example, with tasty examples]]
**** We may need to move this, coz this one is not autotool-specific
*** Common mistakes:
**** always forgetting to update the name of primary/variable (I guess this is why its not accurate to call someAppName_SOURCES, etc, etc variables)
 bin_PROGRAMS = someAppName
 someAppName_SOURCES = src/someAppName.cpp
*** Some custom directories and stuff. Finally understood
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20230827/how-to-set-include-paths-with-autotools
***** The only 1 line required is this in Makefile.am
AM_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/other $(FAKELIB_CPPFLAGS)
***** But some examples put this in configure.ac (or even more):
FAKELIB_CPPFLAGS="-I${FAKELIB_DIR}/other"
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538705/adding-a-custom-installation-directory-option-to-autoconf-generated-configure-sc
***** Tried this with /doc directory. Works but of course, the only 'installing' is copying a README.md to a defined directory (/doc)
***** --- probably triggers an 'argument replacement' in configure. By inserting in configure.ac:
AC_SUBST([docdir], [$docdir])
***** --- once triggered can put inside Makefile.am ---
docdir = @docdir@
doc_DATA = README.md
*** A decently good official example.

*** [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/A%20Basic%20Starting%20Point.html][My first tutorial on CMake]]
**** A seemingly trivial but important difference between CMake and Autotool => is that Autotools is case-sensitive (mostly its special variables)
**** But CMake is NOT case-sensitive
***** Simple run (both works):
cmake .            # ---------- this produces CMakes own intermediary files (Makefile2, Makefile.cmake progress.marks etc..etc...)
cmake --build .    # ---------- this produces the Makefile and final .executable in 1 step
***** or
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ../.
cmake --build .    # ---------- cmake is apparently "blind" which makes it good
**** .h.in
***** separate #define (constants) usually inside .h file
****** why is #define inside .h.in ?
****** Demo_VERSION_MAJOR deduced automatically from CMakeLists.txt
****** not very useful for me (maybe for long-term bigger projects use)
**** Step 2: Adding a library:
***** Is it only in CMake(?):
****** function name is irrelevant!
****** CMake makes it easy, functions like these ----->:
******* add_executable(Demo demo.cpp) & target_link_libraries(Demo PUBLIC library)
******* and add_library(library mysqrt.cpp) in library-level CMakeLists.txt
****** -----> glues the names together. So for one library, .h file & /directory name & .cpp can be all different or the same name (/library & library.h & otherName.cpp)
** Tips
*** [[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/379202/folder-structure-for-a-c-project][Project structure]]
**** Write something
** Tutorials:
*** https://cplusplus.happycodings.com
**** Very useful site for refreshing if youre like me, and have not touched C/C++ in a long long time:
***** === writing something ===
*** https://riptutorial.com/c/example/3250/calling-a-function-from-another-c-file
**** Simple example of calling a function from another C file
**** Basically a header file, but primitive example
*** [[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/map-associative-containers-the-c-standard-template-library-stl/][Professional looking site youre subscribed to]]
**** Write one you seriously read about this
*** Specific cases:
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5838711/stdcin-input-with-spaces
***** How to force cin to take spaces (spaces are probably always a problem due to computing history)
std::string s;
std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, s);
** Common errors:
*** error: ‘someFunction’ was not declared in this scope
**** Check function names in 3 places (Grrrrrr). main.cpp, someFunction.cpp & someFunction.h
**** this is usually scoping issue, which means the function name doesnt exist in space.
***** Reasons ==> wrong naming in the 3 places, (cout produces same error if no -> using namespace std;)
** Alternative Libraries:
*** 2D Game Engine
****
*** 3D Game Engine
**** [[https://wiki.ogre3d.org/Ogre+Wiki+Tutorial+Framework][if we starting Ogre seriously, we rewrite this]]
***** Wewrite maybe not, coz were not using Ogre
* This is so cool:
** https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/getting-started-ncurses
*** this is about the ncurses library
*** has a cool triangle pattern challenge, probably applicable to Python as well
*** has a cool trick of generating random numbers from Eg: 1 to 10 (instead of random.randint(1,10)):
**** yi = getrandom_int() % maxlines; # ---------- modulus as a range cutter

** Something about locales GUIX_LOCPATH, will never allow foreign-distro programs to load GUIX stuff,
*** -> while ensuring GUIX only loads everything foreign  and local.
*** this "foreign-distro" programs cant see GUIX_LOCPATH
** If thats the case, we can install Tramp by:
*** unset the GUIX_LOCPATH variable
*** reload original spacemacs safely

** If that doesnt work then, its safe to
*** reset everything back to GUIX spacemacs, and
*** install TRAMP from there

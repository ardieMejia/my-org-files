* The primary obstacle in teaching Emacs is not the language nor the packages, and the installation. But the navigation. This alone is strong enough reason to teach someone new by installing Spacemacs. But once you are comfortable with Evil navigation in Spacemacs, its time to move slowly towards classic Emacs style navigation. Coz unlocking that is key to opening a whole new world of Emacs eLisp and package possibilities.

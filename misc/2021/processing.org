* How does one create dotted grayscale images the are darker at the center, and brighter at the edges
** In Java:
*** empty array (canvas)
*** maxdistance is half of canvas (w/h)
*** loop through array, and scale coordinates with 255. (distance/maxdistance*255)
*** user parameters are spacers (gray dot resolution is NOT real resolution always)
*** loop through array and -> stroke() point()
** In ImageMagick:
*** create canvas (image or virtual)
*** loop through size with spacers ():
**** distanceFromCenter modulus(x-w/2)
**** scale $color (255*distanceFromCenter) 
**** draw primitive (x,y,xmargin,ymargin) (-circle) (-fill "rgb(255,255,255)") ($color instead of 255)
**** output to file or :miff for next loop 
** In ImageMagick (-fx):
*** Not worth it
* How does one create a fan-out art (lines shine from the center, ending in dots, evenly spaced)
** In Java:
*** empty array (canvas)
*** gridSize (spacing of end-dots)
*** loop through canvas:
**** fill()    (color)
**** rect(x,y,3,3) (3-pixel square)
**** stroke(255,100) (semi-transparent white) (read between the lines, and the details matter, selected transparency makes huge difference, this gives a vapor-trail effect)
**** line(width/2,height/2,x,y) 
** In ImageMagick:

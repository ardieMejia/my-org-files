affixes in languages
 - suffix and prefix
mora in languages like Japanese (their phonology unit), 
 - becoz they dont have syllables
morphosynctatic
 - between morphology (up to the word) and syntax (above word)
 - morpheme: smallest unit of morphosynctatic
 - pens: has 2 (pen & s)
 - pen is free morpheme (a word by itself)
 - s is bound morpheme (not a word by itself)
 - what is recursive structure in sentences and hierarchy structure (VP, NP and PP)
The pen I bought in italy leaks (analyze)
 - NP: The pen I bought in Italy
 - VP: leaks
The pen I bought in italy
 - NP: The pen
 - S: (which) I bought in Italy
I bought in Italy
 - N: I
 - VP: bought in Italy 
"a world without morphology"

a spoken "expression" has 2 structures:
 - morphosynctatic (meaningful elements)
 - phonological (~ pronunciation)
 - these dont map one to one (not isomorphic)
another way to think of this is morpheme dont correspond to syllables (segments)
Eg: Sue is ticklish
 - su:z is 2 morphemes but 1 syllable
 - this is interesting to note when learning a new language, coz then many "words" that otherwise 1 word can consist of 2 meaningful units
The chapter concludes with a spoken "expression" having 2 parallel hierarchical structures.
 - morphosynctatic
 - phonological
And they dont always map 1-to-1

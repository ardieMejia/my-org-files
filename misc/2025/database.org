*** Understanding race condition
*** The example he shows, uses an update clause in JS db library
*** We learnt: the "await" keyword can only be used inside "async" function. Its pause execution until a promise resolves. The example is quite good, where a DB is waited first
** A way to solve it in PostgreSQL
#+begin_src sql

  BEGIN;

-- Lock the account row to prevent concurrent modifications
SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;

-- Perform some application-level logic (e.g., withdraw funds)
-- ...

-- Update the account balance
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;

COMMIT;

#+end_src
* SQL grammar/syntax
** SQL generally returns sets (unless its an expression, that's another subject)
** this "set" can be further processed with "clauses", such as 
*** WHERE
*** GROUP BY
*** HAVING
*** ORDER BY
** Clause?
*** Clause = Subject + Verb
*** Independent clauses ->
*** "She sings"
*** "I went to the store"
*** Dependent clauses->
*** "That I read" in "The book that I read was good"
** Clause example:
#+begin_src sql

  SELECT	elective_class,
  SUM(elective_class) AS total_fees
  FROM students,
  GROUP BY elective_class; -- verbed, subject

  SELECT * FROM students
  ORDER BY elective_class ASC; --verbed, subject, adjective?

#+end_src

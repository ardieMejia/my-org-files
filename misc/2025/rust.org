rustc --explain

scalar types
- pointer-size? size of architecture, thats all
- char is single-quoted,
- stack is sequential, and heap is dynamic ()
- let s: &str = "Rust"
- character, reference string, and string
- tupple = uniqueness, stack
- arrays = fixed size, heap
- struct
- enum = Result, Option
- Reference Types: shared,mutable
- Collections: vectors
- Copy or borrowing
- non-copy = string, vectors,




mutability and copy-type, dont be confused









in Rust we d our best to avoid copy, becoz its expensive

** Equal Sets -> two sets containing the same elements, ignore order and duplicates
** Equivalent Sets -> two sets that contain the same number of unique elements
** NOTE, misnomer:
*** If 2 sets are equal, they are equivalent. Its becoz Equal Sets are like "an identity split into 2, and breeding itself"
** Subsets -> all elements of A are also in B
** Proper Subsets -> all elements of A are also in B, but A is not equal B. (its got foreign extras)
** NOTE, misnomer:
*** Subsets are like an identity, Proper Subsets are essentially something completely different, differnt "breed"

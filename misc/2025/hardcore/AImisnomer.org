** Agent has goals
** independently control its data streams and teach itself based on those goals
** If an agent needs millions of examples to learn that can learn anything, that its not learning
** To become intelligent, it needs to learn how to learn based on its datastream.
** It needs to interact with the world.
** AGI criteria: "continuous learning"
*** fine tuning -> problems -> catatostrophic forgetting, loss of plasticity
*** in-context learning -> problems -> frozen parameters limits learning
** AGI criteria: "single experiential stream of data"
*** problems -> samples from billions of disjointed sources 
*** -> has no ability to learn over longer time horizons
** AGI criteria: "scaling with compute"
** current AI are designed with "big data" mindsets

* Day 1:
** We had to shutdown -h now, as setting up the proxmox hostname from the installed one , is not direct.
** We pressed F2 repeatedly, depends on computer
** commands to check gateway, (this is done on the proxmox we install)
#+begin_quote

ip route | grep default

#+end_quote
** Do we have 2 subnets??
** Only 1, 255.255.255.0 (192.168.0.1 -> 255)
** Issues with installation of Proxmox
*** We are trying this one, for the installation stuck after eif boot mode detected issue:
**** https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/installation-stuck-right-after-efi-boot-mode-detected.129692/
*** We solved this issue by telling the Linux kernel to use the BIOS framebuffer, instead of the graphics driver

*** management IP address, is just an IP address so you manage a device directly, independent of gateway. Eg: for a switche
*** Here the example is a gateway  with the mgmt address --> 192.168.0.10/24 and the address  192.168.0.1
*** The usual structure goes something like this
**** Datacenter:
***** pve
****** 100 (pfsense)
****** 101 (centos-silverr)
****** 102 (centis-client)
****** 103 (centis-clone)
****** 1000 (centos-template)
****** local (pve)
****** local-lvm (pve)
**** local-lvm hlds VM disk images & local holds backups and ISO's
*** NIC (Network Interface Cards) are listed as enp1s0, enp2s0, enp3s0, enp4s0, enp5s0, enp6s0
*** A Linux Bridge does not need an IP address, but in this context we need it for management  (Eg: vmbr0)
*** The vmbr0 us for the (WAN?). The vmbr1 is for the internal network segment, which is in need for its own Linux Bridge
*** If we look at  /etc/network/interfaces, we will the six enp1s0...etc...

*** IP Addresses
**** IP Addresses are divided into classes. (Some allowing a handful of subnets, but lots of hosts per network, others MANY subnets but few hosts per network)
**** Reserved for private use
***** 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255
***** 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0
***** 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.0
*** Firewalls are hosts that are connected to two or more networks, but don't route traffic between them.

*** people often have more devices than the ports their routers have
*** unmanaged switches
*** managed switches
**** more features
**** commonly used ---> VLANS
***** to talk with other VLAN-aware devices (isolated traffic)
***** home --> isolate IoT devices from network
***** biz --> separate bandwidth-sensitive IP-based telephones from normal traffic (to prioritize VOIP)
**** commonly used --> LAGS (Link Aggression)
***** multiple parallel paths to high speed devices
***** NAS that gets used by multi clients. 2 or more ethernet cables between NAS and switch. spread user connections better, no sharing
** [[https://www.practicalnetworking.net/stand-alone/vlans/][best practical explanation of VLAN!]]
*** VLAN allows a single switch to be multiple switches
*** [[./proxmox_and_learnings/VLAN_1.png]]
*** A single switch will have multiple (Eg: 3) VLANS. So, each VLAN is a switch. And a VLAN is simply a number assigned to a switch port. (Eg: 1st port and 2nd port is assigned VLAN #10, followed by empty port 3, 4, and 5, 6 being VLAN #20).
*** Perspective --> we see 3 single frame arriving at the switch. But the switch sees 3 different frames arriving at 1 port at 1 VLAN, exiting at 1 port at the same VLAN
*** In the MAC address table, each MAC line has a VLAN number. The total records have the effect of each VLAN having its own MAC address table.
*** This understanding of each VLANS being independent of each other brings us to --> VLANs allow you to extend you to EXTEND A SINGLE VIRTUAL SWITCH ACROSS MULTIPLE PHYSICAL SWITCHES
**** We understand from the illustration below, that VLAN #10 spans 2 physical switches
**** [[./proxmox_and_learnings/VLAN_2.png]]
**** there are real placement benefits to this. One can have the same VLAN in different rooms (Layer 2 topology)
**** Each connected switch ports (note: CONNECTED) automatically is a member of a single VLAN. Its called Access port --> switch port that is a member of 1 VLAN
*** An Access port is a switch port that is a member of only 1 VLAN
**** Which brings  us next to a Trunk port
*** A Trunk port is a switch port that carries traffic for multiple VLANs
**** Just needs  to configure several VLANs for that single port

**  [[https://www.baeldung.com/linux/network-interface-configure][Wanna understand etc_network_interfaces and other configs]]
*** What happens in etc/network/interfaces (each line)
**** define an interface per line. (usually: interface namee, type, method)
**** define IP address, network mask, gateway 
**** configure DNS server (1 line)
**** execute script after interface enabled (post-up), and others -- pre-down
*** Sometimes, the etc/netork/interfaces is empty. Why?
**** becoz it might be managed by another tool (eg:network manager)
**** Solution: disable network manager
#+begin_quote

$ sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
$ sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager.service

** [[https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/types-of-firewalls][types of firewalls]]
*** A common way to categorize is by placement within network, form factor,  the systems they protect
*** Network firewall
**** between trusted and untrusted network, such as between internal and internet
**** [[./proxmox_and_learnings/firewall_1a.png]]
*** Host-Based Firewall
**** works on a device level. Basically the threats arrice at the device. Ensuring all other devices are protected. Very secure.
**** [[./proxmox_and_learnings/firewall_1b.png]]
*** The following are Firewall types by form factors
*** Hardware Firewall
**** basically, a physical  device, independent of the host.
**** Its  proactive? But according to Linux, its a myth that harrdware firewalls are more secure.
*** Software Firewall
**** same technology as hardware firewall
**** can even be deployed within virtualized networrk

** Making a map (explort as file)
*** https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/making_a_map.html
** Open lay as a table, and perform expression on that single table
*** https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/working_with_attributes.html
** Importing a TSV (first time) or CSV file as a new layer

* Virtualbox going nowhere
** Install vs distributable, this is annoying. (If you dont know which version, just install VirtualBox, and it will complain for you)
*** https://www.debugpoint.com/virtualbox-needs-microsoft-visual-c/
** Install Virtualbox  on Windows 11
*** https://www.guidingtech.com/how-to-install-virtualbox-on-windows/
** Download Lubuntu
*** https://lubuntu.me/downloads/
*** Jammy Jellyfish
** Install Lubuntu
** Things to do after fresh install
*** https://averagelinuxuser.com/ubuntu-22-04-after_install
**** Menu -> Additional drivers -> wait while it is searching for additional drivers -> Install recommended proprietary drivers
**** Install the binary version of firefox
**** install codecs and Microsoft fonts
***** sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras
** Run a Python script from inside Lubuntu. And open  that same file in Windows
** Install Emacs
* Emacs 28 version works!! No need for emacsclient for now
** CANCELED Try the Windows version. Install a better version of Emacs. (26)
*** http://sw-gis.wikidot.com/emacs
*** rename old folder to another. Test if you can still run your codes
*** Install another Emacs rename it to the latest version too
*** Change the config setting to to point to your new Emacs and test your new Emacs
*** Try running first.
*** Check out these links
**** http://sw-gis.wikidot.com/emacs
**** https://github.com/roger-realworld/smallworld
**** http://sw-gis.wikidot.com/tech-emacs
*** ?? ========== how to we continue using the new Emacs for our GIS files ========== ???
** emacs 23/28 under Smallworld
*** Add a new conditional to test for Emacs version
**** https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/35335/how-to-test-for-specific-emacs-version-or-newer
*** move all code so you can continue playing with Vertico, Consult & Marganilia
*** We will try to make an Emacs daemon later using this link (I think its just creating a shortcut with the --daemon option, and then make other apps use Emacs by using their own unqique variables
**** https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html
**** no progress, only followed 2 links, runemacs.exe or emacs.exe (with --daemon) makes no difference
*** 
** Lubuntu Emacs
*** install Vertico, Marganilia, Consult
*** open a file in Emacs, write, & save
*** open in Python edit and save
* Im not sure why we did the rgrep experiment anyway, but it worked. HAHA
** rgrep progress, interesting:
*** We tried using grep from Git bash, doesnt work
*** We installed Cygwin (base package only), added to Emacs's exec-path. Didnt work
*** We explored code in grep.el, our progress in eLisp worth it. We discovered this. Pretty cool that it works.
** Ag, if we have a bigger project, we will use ag coz it uses .gitignore, which means its faster
** https://github.com/k-takata/the_silver_searcher-win32
* Making our Windows 11 an ultimate shortcut powerhouse
** Cross process window activation (Examples: using keybinding to trigger opening a new window. Or after a process runs trigger a window)
*** Its not enabled by default in Windows 11!! --> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73675340/how-to-bring-gui-window-to-front-after-an-event/73675531#73675531
*** On second thought, it does work
** Actually we made our script. but will not work with a minimized window, so instead we try installing a module mentioned here
*** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4993926/maximize-window-and-bring-it-in-front-with-powershell
* Meetings
** Meeting 1
*** MCMC Malaysia Oooooo
*** TM (GIS, but not full-fledged)
*** Atlas (GeoSpatial product), not a full fledged GIS. POC in place
*** TNB GIS
**** asset performance management system
**** what is CR? --> ooooo, fibre optic
*** IQGeo
*** Fibre planning
*** automatic digitization
*** some rural areas still dont have 5G fibre optic. so we need solution
*** Atlas front end uses Javascrript
*** IQGeo also uses Javascript as frontend. Oh nooooo!! Communication with server uses Python. 
*** swmfs on Linux uses an encrypted file containing passworde??
*** Yayy, Kubernetes. Oh nooooo
*** Azure and AWS. OH nooooo. I dont understand
*** what is SAP?? users have trouble using SAP. 
*** optimization using map tile caching (web service improvement)
*** utility model framework. GNS uses different format to store coordinates. not that WGS thing.
*** in electric office, not much, but changes to data models
*** VMDS cloud. in the future it will use postgres. 
*** Smallworld DNA. and VMDS uniqueness. Preserve long running trasaction as much as possible.
*** Devops implemented, CI-CD

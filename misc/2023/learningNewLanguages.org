*** __init__()


What is __init__()

Its a "magical" function that is called automatically everytime you create an object



*** self.


What is self.

Put it in front of a variable, it becomes an attribute. The magic here is that it is attached to every object created. Example: John, Ahmad, Zhee all have a self.name. (self. refers to themselves).

We dont think about it too much, basically its like a normal variable, except its special, coz its different depending on the object you creata (each new person, each new car, etc....)

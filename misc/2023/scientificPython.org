* Since last week we discovered GeoPandas, there is just FAR too much information already to consider.
* The nature of learning scientific Python is different from your average programming fun
* You have to understand more about the package itself, but more so about the data structure itself (boring)
* These are about Panda Dataframes (glorified arrays)
** https://realpython.com/pandas-dataframe/

#+begin_src python

data = {
    'name': ['Xavier', 'Ann', 'Jana', 'Yi', 'Robin', 'Amal', 'Nori'],
    'city': ['Mexico City', 'Toronto', 'Prague', 'Shanghai',
             'Manchester', 'Cairo', 'Osaka'],
    'age': [41, 28, 33, 34, 38, 31, 37],
    'py-score': [88.0, 79.0, 81.0, 80.0, 68.0, 61.0, 84.0]
}


#+end_src

** The key of this associated array becomes the column header/labels. Keep this intuition handy
*
** ==================================================
** pandas.Series are just the columns (or even row) you extracted from data above, such as /data.city/. Misleading a bit the panda.series
** You can also get the name of a specific item, using the number.

#+begin_quote
cities[2]
>>> Toronto
#+end_quote

**** The number gets created by Panda as a column

* Personal stuff I installed
** smallworld software so boring coz its closed source
** Emacs 23, so boring coz its so old
** VirtualBox, Lubuntu.etc...
** PowerToys for keyboard shortcuts
** Git
* (Official) Stuff I did so far.
** we downloaded 3 files
** Emacs, emacs.rar (??), EO installer
** Moved it to E drive
** moved Emacs and extract at same level as SmallWorld
** We also added some config to gis_aliases under core/config

emacs:
EMACSROOT    = E:\SmallWorld\emacs-28.2
title    = GNU Emacs 28.2
program    = %EMACSROOT%\bin\runemacs.exe
icon_file    = %SW_WHICH_GIS_ALIAS_PARENT_DIR%\bin\runemacs.exe
log_file    = nul:
product    = emacs
EMACSLOADPATH    = %EMACSROOT%\share\emacs\28.2\lisp; %EMACSROOT%\share\emacs\site-lisp
PATH    = %PATH%;%EMACSROOT%\bin
HOME    = %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%


** copy license -> message.ds under smallworld_registry
** Change file properties of EO_Demo (target, arguments like -a)

E:\SmallWorld\core\bin\x86\gis.exe -a "E:\SmallWorld\electric_office\config\gis_aliases" -e "E:\SmallWorld\core\config\environment.bat" emacs


** Run config program under core
** Had to add Everyone as new group at parent directory, before anything happened. Finally clicking "Show Licenses" finally worked

* Personal stuff I installed
** smallworld software so boring coz its closed source
** Emacs 23, so boring coz its so old
** VirtualBox, Lubuntu.etc...
** PowerToys for keyboard shortcuts
** Git
* (Official) Stuff I did so far.
** we downloaded 3 files
** Emacs, emacs.rar (??), EO installer
** Moved it to E drive
** moved Emacs and extract at same level as SmallWorld
** We also added some config to gis_aliases under core/config

emacs:
EMACSROOT    = E:\SmallWorld\emacs-28.2
title    = GNU Emacs 28.2
program    = %EMACSROOT%\bin\runemacs.exe
icon_file    = %SW_WHICH_GIS_ALIAS_PARENT_DIR%\bin\runemacs.exe
log_file    = nul:
product    = emacs
EMACSLOADPATH    = %EMACSROOT%\share\emacs\28.2\lisp; %EMACSROOT%\share\emacs\site-lisp
PATH    = %PATH%;%EMACSROOT%\bin
HOME    = %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%


** copy license -> message.ds under smallworld_registry
** Change file properties of EO_Demo (target, arguments like -a)

E:\SmallWorld\core\bin\x86\gis.exe -a "E:\SmallWorld\electric_office\config\gis_aliases" -e "E:\SmallWorld\core\config\environment.bat" emacs


** Run config program under core
** Had to add Everyone as new group at parent directory, before anything happened. Finally clicking "Show Licenses" finally worked
* Learning progress (user)
** [%HOME%] runalias eo_open -login root
** We learned how to create a map, resize that map area & add a legend
** We learned how to update the state of the map (so it shows in green instead of red)
** There projections we can change, but we always us WGS projection, standard
** we learnt using the app manager (I dont remember what we did with the administration suite)
** "How to get help" will open the official help website
** ==================================================
** we learnt about object types, chains (line), points (raster?), area (polygon). Please fix this one.
** we can refresh the whole database, or the whole map
** Geometry
*** joint,valve,roundabout = point
*** cable,pipeline,road = line
*** substation,duct,park = area
*** name,length = annotation
*** background map, scanned image, surface model = raster
** File -> new project and design 
*** after creating details, always remember to say "no" to checking for overlap
** File -> Browser design -> "Design Browser"
*** we clear filter & and "run query"n to list all designs
** File -> New Checkpoint
*** When we go to app manager, and open suite admin, we can see our named version
*** I dont understand this part at all
** File -> State Model Viewer -> "shows the possible state paths"
** ==================================================
** We about design
*** DM_top is the upmost layer/object
*** When we first open we are presented with DM_top
*** We then create a new design
** We learnt the object editor
*** We learnt insert, update and delete a trail geometry
*** By adding a new trail, we can lock, highlight, and move-to. To navigate back to that point after some journey
*** There are mandatory fields
*** We forgot we can actually clear trail by right-clicking
** Object editor, we filed mandatory fields after creating trail (area), must fill extent, tick mark. Remark to update
** version management
*** We create a new checkpoint from the window
*** It has numbering naming system in the database, not our chosen name
***** Good names like, "before delete", "before update"
***** New alternative creates child checkpoints
***** Rollback and commit. rollback = undo to last changes. commit = save
*****
** ==================================================
** Collection -> Field
** UG OH MV HV lV
** visibility, selectibility, hitability
** copying properties for insertion?
*** select existing cable, create trail, select "geometry from trail", click "insert"
* Wishlist:
** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42566799/how-to-bring-focus-to-window-by-process-name
*** Basically write a Powershell script that switches focus to another app. Better idea is down below, to use Window name, instead of process name

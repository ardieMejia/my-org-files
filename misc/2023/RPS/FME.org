*** Scenario 1
**** FME has some featueres/tools that help converting Microstation (basically CAD software) drawings of Forest Cover to GI ready datasets
***** AreaBuilder
***** PointOnArea Overrlayer
**** Enabling Featurecaching allows dynamic  live view,  while we work on the transformation workflow
****  FME essentially helps "expose" certain fields
*** Scenario 2 (Migrating CAD drawings to GIS)
**** Transforming CAD to  GeoJSON
**** TextPropertyExtractor 
**** PointOnAreaOverlay too, combine multiple entities into oen
**** use Tester
*** Scenario 3 (Pretty powerful stuff)
**** Moving labels to Attr with Proximity
**** For some reason, containment cannot be used
**** Proxomity matching with NeighbourFinder
**** Task: moving label information to nearby lines

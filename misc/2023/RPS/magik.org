* Magik:
** 
* Java Pathway (either we move or delete this later)
** Class and Objects
** Attributes are variables
** class methods (not public static void main)
** static method (accessible without object creation) vs public method (the opposite)
** class constructor --> public SoMeClAsSnAmE() --> basically __init__ but NOT public-static-void-main
** astract is still confusing to me. Why do you need to do 2 methods? One definition and one with the body? Anyway, it uses the keyword "extend"
* Reminder:
** Remember why OOP is shit. There so much implication in that single dot (.). If objects are complex, like in real life, then there is too much implication in SoMeObJeCt.SoMeMeThOd()

* Im not used to grep, coz never had the need to search a SINGLE text project-wise. And searching recursively by conventional "turning on" optione produces lots of confusion. None of the online tips/tricks help for Cygwin version of grep, so when recurse use this link:
** https://superuser.com/questions/666577/grep-does-not-recurse-for-files-with-a-specific-extension
*** Basically, when searching name ardie, our intuition tells us this makes sense:

grep -r ardie  *.c

*** But it actually means: from the current directory, search all directories that match *.c then recursively search pattern ardie
*** So we should do this, instead.

grep --include \*.c -r ardie .

*** Which means: from this directory, search all subdirectories, then search all files matching *.c for the pattern ardie

*** BUt then again, that also doesnt work, this works under grep

*** The last guy nailed the issue, saying cygwin grep, the -r doesnt behave properly



"e:/cygwin/bin/grep.exe oo -r  . --include \*org"

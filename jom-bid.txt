🤩 Handmade inlaid wooden organizer with simple nail lock 🤩 

💪 I could describe my woodworking as mainly handmade and using upcycled wood...
But that would only be half the story. I love woodworking coz its where I feel most alive and protected. It makes me feel like a superhero. And every cash you spend is channeled towards improving the process and the ritual. Coz I live in the process, and it is where the magic happens. It is where I discover more efficient/cheaper ways to do things (bringing cost down further), and sometimes I discover something more beautiful. Coz in woodworking, the process/ritual is just as important as the result.
(That is my epic intro, and now to the bid)

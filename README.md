# My org files



My emacs .org files. A flow of my thoughts. Never meant to be messed about online. But cloneable on any laptop/desktop anywhere. 

  - non-programming related
  - attempt at learning electronics (failed)
  - and keep bookmarking my other hobbies that I discovered along the way (woodworking, crocheting, hahaha)

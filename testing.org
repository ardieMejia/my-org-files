* What I will accomplish today:
** TODO Read a bit more about Emacs
** https://brainstats.com/report/yNEJophxGjj7efryf.html
** TODO To write in blogs or elsewhere:
*** TODO Theremin:
**** TODO Check out this video, about a unique musical instrument, that evolved into mainstream musicians.
**** TODO Coming from a musical background, this doesnt sound very intuitive at all, and no acoustic instrument (apart from the pitch aspect, similar to  fret-less string instruments like violins) comes anything close to concept. So it will be probably take a lot of re-training and mental re-adjustment for most musicians to learn a Theremin. I only heard a joke about this Theremin from a rather old American programmer in his old website: www.jwz.org. It wsa actually a joke about programmers, and the post about how "Real men dont use menus. I want to know how to use power commands.". One comment posts noted how hand waving was implied in the comic of the post, to which someone replied dat they dont use Theremin. Thats actually the first time I heard of Listingsuch a term. On youtube, theres a bunch of Theremin videos, even a metal Theremin video, but interestingly, theres a clip from The Big Bang Theory of Sheldon playing his Theremin. 
**** TODO So, I was thinking that the next step for Power User's (or maybe just people who wanna prove a point) would be to use just use hand-waving. Time for someone with sufficient keyboard hardware knowledge, and a Theremin expert to build a more accessible Theremin-like alternative for keyboard (And hopefully no software-level modifications, software is perhaps is more boring but more practical, but a proper dedicated hardware modifications would make it work for any Windows, Mac OS X or Linux).
**** TODO Why, did I write about Theremin in the first place?? Shouldn't I be writing about some new Linux distributions that is super cool, and works blazingly fast on my new Thinkpad. How about writing a new vertically-staggered ergonomic nonsense keyboard for emacs users and hackers. Weird.
**** TODO Modern hardware = the magical power of cheap Asian labor, more specifically cheap Chinese labor. 
**** TODO I also found a bunch of really cool retro-like technology youtubers, better than that Chinese-shill Linus Sebastian. And yet it is not really helping me at all with my focus and direction. 
*** TODO Interesting that I use to struggle when dealing with Javascript objects, or as the "CTO" claimed, I cant tell difference between arrays and objects. Now, it all seems rather intuitive, but only because ALMOST ALL programming languages have embraced object-oriented approach wholeheartedly, and all these boring wanker all look the same. Apparenty, once classes/objects are defined properly, calling variable (members) and calling methods (member functions), look EXACTLY from outside (implementation). Quite, interesting. I wish I couldmake this into an interesting teaching point, when I teach other students. 
*** TODO Very interesting read about Hannah Arendts theory or totalitarianism. Who is Hannah Arendts? Dont know. How I came across this site? Also dont know. Anyway, here is the cool link.
**** TODO http://rozenbergquarterly.com/hannah-arendts-theory-of-totalitarianism-part-two/
*** TODO Read about compiler comparison, such as your bookmarked colfaxresearch.com. 
**** TODO If you wanna really impress yourself try reading featured tests (called microkernels) such as:
***** TODO LU decomposition (which uses data structures and memory access patterns)
***** TODO an implementation of a Jacobi solver for the Poisson problem on a square domain.
***** TODO an implementation of "structure function computation"
**** TODO https://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/tag/compiler-testing/ Interesting article about how compiler validation is now part of history, and also evidence of my suspicion, that modern hardware are hardly original or innovative. (Its not just mobile phones that are not exciting, but desktops are monotonous and monopolized, there are no more innovation in the hardware world, whether it be the CPU, RAM, chipset, GPU). Article further notes the mass extinction of non-Intel hardware during the 1990's, and the spread of open-source compilers also helped many compiler business to dissapear from the market. Such is the depressing state of software in today's world. Where is the excitement?
*** TODO I remember how many Chinese programmers Ive met seem to associate the skill of programming language, with logic and rationality. From what Ive read about software development in general (and that is many articles), programming and its many concepts that stem from it: is more than culture than science. I always knew deep down, good programmers dont often make good mathematicians, and good mathematicians dont often make good programmers. I just didn't bother to gather the research articles to back this claim.
**** TODO What concept that is often associated with this, is "analysis ny paralysis". Read: "Analytics is meant to improve decision-making, but it can also do harm. One of the most common harms is “analysis paralysis” where the organization is so busy analyzing the options that it doesn’t make a timely decision"
*** TODO Did you know that psychology was banned under Mao in China? wow...
**** TODO https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/03/china-psychiatrists-talking-therapy-counselling
**** TODO Interestingly, the article states how the problem of psychotherapy in China, as a profession, stems also from common cultural differences. Many in China dont understand the point of formal aspects of Western psychotherapy, such as "why they have to see you every week at the same time". Quite shockingly (or interestingly), the general sentiment among Chinese patients is that, if the patient likes the doctor, "Why can't we just go out for a dinner". Also interesting (or scary, depending on whether such belief is normalized in society), is that fundamental goals in psychotherapy in China is to "overcome the self", as opposed to the Western "building a stronger self". And yet, despite  all the pessimistic conclusions. There is still an air of hope, as the article noted: "Maybe there will be a new beginning to psychoanalysis that can be fed by Chinese thinking." 
*** TODO They say programmers dont often make good artists, in fact most of them suck at artistic talent.
**** TODO  I have a sneaking suspicion that the advent of the call to programmers is a sign of a dying Western culture, as well as an attempt at Asians (especially the Chinese), to get the last golden eggs from the Western goose. Whatever words can create, they can destroy, and the destroyer often comes in the form of ingratitude. Although many young top Chinese programmers in today's world have studied in the West, they often dont share a love of Western ideals unlike most immigrants, especially American ideals. From an outsider, being a programmers can easily be confused with being a computer scientist, and yet, many of the amazing expressiveness of modern programming languages, is the result of many years of development and sacrifice on the part of Computer Scientists in America. Stricly speaking, while programming is certainly logical, it is not a science, or perhaps it is closer to applied sciences. Many of the progresses in software technology, and its relative pleasantness (at least for programmers), is due to the many sacrifices of Western academicians, sacrifices on every level, the physical, the mental, political, philosophical. And specifically in programming languages, the result of that sacrifice, and the beauty of programming is you can generally call "abstraction". For those who know, theres no point in denying that the tech industry, especially that of software industry, is a primarily liberal, an agressively liberal field. (2) And despite the revelation that Chinese programmers are often highly logical, and would win the programming olympics in a few categories (ref.), on a philosophical level, it is mostly a case of Chinese practicality taking advantage of a primarily and singularly Western success. Only a culture that can be agressively liberal and religiously conservative like America and many of its neighbours, would produce any philosophical notions such as "open source", "freedom", "proprietary", license and copyright. Im convinced that no version of Asia (or China for that matter), from whatever alternate history earth, would be able to produce such a software culture. And yet here we are, living in a world filled with Indian tech support and China's tech startups having excessive money, and mostly riding on the wave of success of Giant tech corporations like Facebook and Google. (3) A few young American geeks have to come to the realization that modern day hardware and software, despite its power and speed, is no longer exciting, or even that competitive (all the proper sacrifices have been made by the true heroes, such as the guys who invented the programming languages, or the guys who write the compilers that help programming more pleasant). While programming can still offer many creative challenges, with big boys like Facebook, Google and Youtube, many companies seem to be converging to a single direction, more Javascript. (4) Where did it all go wrong? When it comes to pure excitement and innovation, modern technologies seem rather predictable. Mobile phones are becoming purely status symbols. And lets face it, hate Apple as much you want, apart from Samsung, the Chinese alternatives (such as Huawei and Xiaomi) aren't exactly doing anything original. (5) I always believed over-specialization was over-rated, in whatever field. And isolating your skill/field and over-specializing, in the case of the software world (I will make a prediction here), will result in software guys who think their skill is all that matters, but will not be able to make a huge creative leap connecting software, hardware and the real world. This is why guys like me are fascinated with development boards like Raspberry Pi. Its also partly the reason for the romanticization of Linux and the appeal of minimialist software that Linux offers to some folks, for better or for worse. (6) Im not sure if its just an Asian thing, but my experience in browsing through slightly old laptops in most computer stores, shows a general smugness towards any interest in these barely 2-3 years old hardware. When mentioning my interest in such still useful hardware, they generally smirk, with a hint of laughter. From a cultural perspective of my country, these staff are generally slightly better than most types of staff in lesser computer stores (such as in Mid Valley). But of course, its highly likely that most of their knowledge of hardware and software, especially software, is probably superficial, and doesn't extend far beyond the technical (technical, such as how to replace a (an already modular) CPU, and other impressive "skills" already made easy by the focus on modularity by hardware manufacturers themselves).

*** TODO A little about Web Development:
**** TODO A good idea is to put a background color AND padding: such as 1.2em & gold, for the: header, footer, article, nav, div. Works surprisingly well.
**** TODO Nested tables in html, apparently there are 2 ways to do it, (which is a "good" way to do it?):
***** TODO One where multiple <td>s are nested inside one <tr>
***** TODO Another (which can also look really nice, for some reason), where each <td> has its own <tr>, maybe used only for main header columns, not sure, but can also look nice
**** TODO quackit.com has some really cool simple templates, for those who dont want anything complicated:
***** TODO https://www.quackit.com/html/templates/simple_website_templates.cfm
** TODO Very general about web development:
*** TODO Database:
**** TODO Apparently, SQLLite is embedded database (& very popular among JS developers nowadays?)
**** TODO Apparentl, you can actually your web app to several (different) database technology, such MySQL and PstgreSQl at the same time! Wow, interesting
*** TODO OOP:
**** TODO When it comes creating classes, and naming files for class objects. From a beginners perspective, its easy to get confused as to why files are named in a certain way. Personally, I always assumed that the filename HAS to match the classes inside. Actually, no, the filenames are often conventions, such as in Java & PHP. And in reality, you can name your filenames anyway you want.
**** TODO I guess there really is no point in fighing the state of programming world nowadays. Just go along with it, there is some success in it actually (despite a certain geniuses criticism of it.. no pun intended). One thing I learned recently about OOP, is that by virtue of clever naming of your function, or how you extend the name of your function, you create another layer of abstraction, or another layer of code organization (the naming precedes the organization). Such as the example of SumCalculatorOutputter in this example (horrible naming IMO):
***** TODO https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design
**** TODO Referring to the above point, another abstraction/organization/separation referred to in the example is by virtue of naming the typeOfCalculation. Weird and unusual concept, since strictly speaking, calculations are NOT objects. But in the example, AreaCalculation and VolumeCalculation are objects. And passing shapes inside contructors, different calculations can be applied to each shapes, instead of putting many methods (area, volume, blabla) inside all shapes (circle, square, ellipse, rectangle). 
***** TODO Example is too simple, so separation to this extent is not necessary. Must think of better example. 
*** TODO For the assignment, what I need to read:
**** TODO MVC entry point, eloquent, scotch.io, RESTful API, 
** TODO Some other Linux scripting tools:
*** TODO Imagemagick:
**** the -annotate option creates an object everytime
**** the -shade option apparently overrides background color setting, it operates on a grayscale, so xc:grey or xc:black (or white) has an effect
**** imagemagick commands seem to blur the lines between formats, leadingto some confusing behaviour. For example while -compose screen -composite, I ve always though of woking for only 2 photos/pictures. When combined with 3 or more, it automatically creates a .gif format to cater to the multiple images. Very useful, very powerful, but can be confusing.
*** TODO bash:
**** TODO its almost as if bash syntax was created solely to confuse programmers who are used to other common languages. The array for example, is one of the rarest that doesnt use comma, but space as a separator (Even Python's weird spacing rules doesnt do that). Even referencing it back is weird: curly brackets to reference it, similarly weird to its usage of parenthesis in similar cases.
** TODO Serious software:

** TODO Read about Python stuff such as:
*** TODO Lessons?:
**** TODO Sometimes, its best to all python lists or arrays, as iterables, the behaviour sometimes dont make sense, and it can shock you a bit as to what works and what doesnt, an example is that in some functions, parethesis lists/arrays can be replaced with square brackets and still work
*** TODO again about naming convention, underscore and double underscore

** TODO Cool/fun projects:
*** TODO Apparently, from php-form-sending stuff, you can think every page as having a unique ID. Thats right!! Not just functions and elements having unique names and ID's. And by hiding an element (hidden element), any succeeding page can know the previous,I guess. Perhaps, a rather childish way to do thinks. Part of the cleverness is from cleverly naming your files, as careful naming as your function.
*** TODO What I have learnt so far:
**** TODO I have finally understood AJAX request, although at a basic level, that is sending single requests for a single XML or JSON file. And not yet a cooler feature like imageuploading. 
*** TODO Start from scratch again (for 1 part). create image interface that keeps on looping storing at least 4 pair of coordinates
*** TODO Also rename effectsOverOneImage.php to something like switch_effectsSelector.php
*** TODO A Java (or Javascript) class for a blinking effect, maybe call it something like oneSecondBlinkElement, twoSecondBlinkElement. Of course more flexible would be to accept any number as a second, but that would be pointless, since it would "break" artistic effect. Remember programmers generally dont make good artists, or any good sense of user interface. Clever naming of such functions would be a cool way to help yourself (and maybe others) as a programmer
*** TODO Make a photo app (like your last project), that has a contrast effect, font placement effect (with multiple font choices), another font effect but with dynamic background (depending on the average color of a small area clicked on). But now, think of ways to make it more impressive. Make sure the interface is more pleasant, the font effect with dynamic background should be its own separate function. Perhaps after clicking the photo in the lists, you display a singular photo (this is a single PHP file), with an effect dropdown list, and choosing an effect will trigger an (isset) PHP function to process the photo. This way you can have all those crazy functions inside 1 file. Later we can separate this in an include file. 
*** TODO A jQuery example showed how easy it is to create slideshow of several images, as long as it exists inside elements (and operated through jQuery's operation on wrapped set). Can I do the same by loading element selected through multi-select listbox in html? Since this is an animation effect, it will have separate page than the rest. The page will show all images & multiselect listbox, with function of jQuery inside the same page, itself wrapped inside PHP conditional (inside (isset) function). So all this is also 1 page only. The only thing that inside the conditional (isset) is the animation display. The animation doesnt accept seconds as parameters, instead it uses 3 settings: "slow","medium" and "fast".
*** TODO A table (no.... not again), that changes the font size depending the number of lines in each <td>. This idea, is partly inspired by Terry's Davis's statement that the most programming structure in C is the switch statement, and the CIA wants you to believe that is similar to if/else, which it isnt. Of course, I should come up with something more impressive than that.
*** TODO This idea is based on the thought of auto-generating art based on a primary and secondary color. But later, after the experiments in Php, it is overly cumbersome, and a much better to start simple. So:
**** DONE First, a php button creator, which takes a primary and secondary color, creates white or black text that overlays depending on how dark it is.

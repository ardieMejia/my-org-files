** The character:
*** Insert the filr provided in example tutorial. “File” → “Place.”
*** adjust artboard to match file dimension. “Object” → “Artboards” → “Fit to Artwork Bounds.”
*** block the new layer, rename it "Sketch"
*** create another layer above Sketch and call it "Lines"
*** Trace the image with the Pen tool (create fill-colored outline):
**** trace back outline becoz we are doing cartoons
**** draw external and internal lines
**** use Shape Builder  tool to swap fill and stroke color
**** Again with Shape Builder tool, click the space between the internal and external lines, it will hae the fill color
*** For simple small shapes like forehead wrinkles, just draw closed shape, then swap
*** For eyes, use Ellipse tool, then set stroke width
*** Notice we are always closing the path, so changing color is just a click
*** We acheive good effects by positioning some parts over another (for later)
*** The hand holding the old phone is slightly strange, requires 2 shapes, fingers and palm
*** Hide the Sketch later, and we will see our vectors
*** use Magic Wand tool and select Fill color, with tolerance 20
